I work for an amazing family who so thoughtfully picked this spa, especially for me, so I could have a ""normal"" fun outing, WITHOUT worrying about Covid.
I LOVE being pampered and having my nails done, however, since the pandemic lockdown I've LITERALLY been to work...ONLY. Im ""high risk"" with a heart condition and chronic high blood pressure, so I've been too terrified.
But, my amazing thoughtful boss-friend did lotsa research and found this PERFECT LITTLE GEM!!!
We were greeted with a genuine smile and we're guided down our path to beauty and relaxation!!
When we realized the music playing was Korean/K-POP we knew it would be perfect!
I was instantly at ease and knew it was safe here. So clean, and obviously sanitation is a top priority. Every product is free of toxins! The staff were all very careful and willing to go any extra mile we may have needed to feel safe. THIS PLACE IS BEAUTIFUL ❤️ The ladies were all so so so nice and we All 4 had great conversation the entire time!
I got a citrus manicure and pedicure and scalp massage in the inversion chair.....OMG!!!!
I haven't felt so nice and free of stress in a very long time.
I can't stop telling everyone around me how great it was at Sweet Mia...and I really can't wait till the next time I'm able to go here!!
THANK YOU SWEET MIA💅❤️",,"{'time': 1611975621972, 'text': 'Hello Emily! Thank you so much for taking your time writing us an amazing review. We are looking forward to seeing you again soon'}",0x87b6edf81cc9a2a1:0xbfd2a730c07bad30,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He eats, sleeps and lives baseball as his career continues to the junior college level.  Baseballism has some great boutique Baseball niche apparel that appeals to both of us.

Quality:  After browsing around, the high quality materials and stitching were evident in shirts and baseball caps.  Shirts with screen printing came out clean.   I didn't come across any item that look or felt cheap in any way.  They put out quality gear all around.

Design:  There's plenty of hats and shirts with baseball designs, messages and innuendos that I didn't get but my nephew new the reference for all those designs.  They had some great gear influenced by my favorite baseball movie of all time ""Major League""  The Ricky 'wild thing' Vaughn and Pedro Cerrano gear was great.  The quote of ""there's no crying in baseball"" from ""A league of their own""  caught my eye as well.  I really appreciated the patriotic influences in their logo and their hats.  Their love of our awesome country is evident.

If you're in the area after a Giants game, walk across the street and check them out.  I loved how Baseballism came about, I copied and pasted their story below.  Enjoy!

""In the beginning, Baseballism was a youth baseball camp founded by four former college baseball players and teammates with a passion to teach the game the right way. The camp ran strong for two years and focused on the fundamentals of the game as well as the life lessons learned on the diamond.

After two years of camp the founders went their separate ways; one became a teacher, one a military lawyer, one a sports sales rep and one a finance manager. Five years later the former teammates restored Baseballism as a premium off the field brand focusing on the class, tradition and history of baseball.

Now in a different industry, the roots of the original Baseballism Youth Camp and passion for the game are present in every garment and accessory. A brand built for love of the game.""",,,0x808f7f8d06939357:0xef07092f277c60c1,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their portion of green curry is probably 20% more than any other place I've ever been and yet a chicken green curry is only $10.95.   The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is there noodle dishes were not spot on.  The pad thai that I had the day before lacked flavor and sauce.   The pad see ew I had was served with American broccoli and carrots which is contradictory to the picture they have on their website.   The service can be a little unorthodox and I'm not sure if it's a breakdown between their kitchen and service staff but everyone tries really hard.  The server I had on two occasion's works really hard and she does a good job.   You really can't be too critical for the portion size and the prices they are currently charging.

Comfortable seating, great sightlines throughout the house, and a moderately-sized proscenium stage create a lively but intimate atmosphere in which it's a thorough pleasure to enjoy live performances.

We had the unique pleasure of meeting some members of the project's board of directors who come out to work in the theater during shows. I'm terrible at names and sadly failed to record the name of the gentlemen that we spoke to, but they were deservedly enthusiastic about their theater.

One of them gave us a tour of the upstairs balcony level (which wasn't open during the show we were seeing),which includes a lovely gallery space and more comfortable seating, well-raked for a great view from every seat. He also gave us a thorough introduction to the Grand's history.

Concessions are very reasonably priced, with proceeds and tips (eager volunteers staff the stand) going to support the Grand's ongoing revitalization. We enjoyed a good-sized prosecco and a medium Diet Coke for $7 (plus $2 for the tip jar that goes to support the project). Patrons may bring their refreshments into the theater (which even offers cup-holders ... perhaps not incredibly elegant, but very useful when you need both hands to applaud!).

One last thing: the Grand is located in the heart of Frankfort's small but diverse downtown, which is overflowing with local businesses-- artists' and artisans' galleries, restaurants, cafés, and more. Leave yourself some time to enjoy the local color (and flavors!).

We will definitely be returning to visit the Grand and Frankfort's vibrant little arts hub, and I  recommend both. Whether you're coming from afar or on the briefest ""staycation,"" the Grand is well worth the visit.",[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO1V5rGeYSp7JY5Yu5fabH8yKMoV76SbgXm1QQr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}],,0x884274c9e1beb9cf:0x2cc0d328f0736a93,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Service is good. There has been just one employee working when we've gone, but they are always friendly and helpful. They also do a very good job of making sure everyone is helped right away or knows they will be right with them when they are done preparing the previous order.

Those service members who are anything less than customer friendly end up leaving. Also, it's great that in the summer months I can lessen or pause my services if I know the kiddos and I will be out of town etc..  I would say the only room for improvement is a need for an upgrade to the children's area, needing more group fitness space for say , kickboxing/jujitsu, and more cafe/business area space for those who need to jump on a quick meeting call prior to or post workout.",,,0x87f7d823895031d9:0x16fe4d904540dd44,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It would be nice if you could extend it for more than just one time a month with the flexibility for me to bring a different person every time.

If they want to join they will do it at their own time.
The area of weights needs supervision and they need staff willing to help and keep it organized. Staff needs to be watching members for any help or questions about the equipment and how to use it. Caffeteria is great!

I did not need as I am actively seeing a physical therapist and they give me my excersizes.

when I went to cancel, i have my reasons i spent 15 minutes being pressured and not listened to. at all about why I wanted to cancel, and my reasons dis not matter to the person I was talking to.

and then told even though I was told it is a month to month and I could cancel anytime, well that is a lie. they wanted me to pay for another month and a half that I would not use.
having to pay for another month and a half is not cancel anytime.

The past couple times at least one person at my table has had to send their food back. I usually get the same thing at any mexican restaurant I go to and add green peppers, they are the only one who charges me extra. They now only give you a certain amount of chips and salsa and charge for a refill. When the good comes out, it's always cold and the servers are never friendly. Their manager passed in a car accident and it seems like ever since then the experience has gone downhill. It's sad that the longtime restaurant in Lafayette has changed so drastically. I'm aware process go up and etc, but if their service was better, and food like it used to taste, they would have more traffic and not have to charge for a few strips of bell peppers or refills of chips and salsa",,,0x88131cf62a0ab8a9:0xe73b5108a9fa32e4,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The massage was a perfect amount of intensity and deep tissue pressure. We did not expect to enjoy the thai style stretching and body flexing as much as we did. We both left feeling very loose and relaxed with no discomfort. Both masseurs were perfect at finding our problem areas and working through them so that they freed up and got comfortable by the end. My girlfriend isnt particularly fond of having her feet or legs massaged, bu they did a great job with full body massage and she loved it. I would highly reccomend their services for people who work long hours standing or need to be limbered up and flexible. All of my joints and muscles felt completely free after just one visit. I'll definitely be going back in the future.

They took us both in with only a 15 minute heads up walk in, but I would maybe suggest setting an appointment. Amy was running the shop that day and had to step out a few times to handle calls. I think with an appointment they would have the right staff planned to handle everything. The room was comfortable and the tables were very large and accommodating. There isnt really any parking to speak of, but we were able to easily park close on a side street. Our price for two one hour massages with a tip was fair and I'd say the same or comparable to any place out in chinatown or elsewhere.",,,0x8640bf5fa4b2c4e1:0x771e80e85eea2c3b,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The repairs are spot on not a single complaint. Time frame don't know how but I feel like they were telling me it was ready before I had set phone down from saying go on repairs. My only complaint it is was completely Hassel free just not what I'm used to. But I suppose if good solid honest quick and affordable are words you want to describe your mechanics 9 mile is the place for you. Also I had spoke with manager telling him i knew the axle was gonna have to be swapped. He informed me it in fact did not. I basically offered another 600 and he was on the level seriously you should give this place a go.,,,0x8824d72d88728ce3:0xe39dc0aa304c0aad,,,,,,,,,,,,,

110815367868504463363,Anti Establishment,1596407029279.0,5.0,Today I came here for the first time based off of a recommendation and I am glad I came. The pastor and staff was very friendly and I was treated like I was family.  I was greated by all of the staff and was given a bag full of candy along with a free Bible along with other things. I was very impressed and I have joined as a new member of this church. I am so happy I found this church the environment and atmosphere was amazing. I would highly recommend that you join this church you won't be disappointed. I felt like God came into me today through the holy spirit and I felt a born again experience today.I have felt so relaxed today and feel like a changed man. The church band was very entertaining and keep me awake and focused and even at the end of the mass I was awake and was able to focus decently. I have really bad ad hd and I didn't get one erge to fall asleep. I was little fedgie at the end because of my ad hd but I really had a great experience here. I am going to try to come to mass at least once a month here and become involved in the church in some fashion. This church is so much better than St Therese of Leisix the Catholic Church that I went to when I was younger. Before today I haven't gone to a church in like 7 or 8 years since me and my family decided to leave the Catholic Church because of the Catholic sex abuse scandal. I am so happy God lead me back to church and found me a place where I could worship God and feel like I was welcomed. I didn't feel like I was treated special at St Therese of Leisix. Anyone who reads this review please know you are welcome at this church and God loves you.,,,0x8824dde1823f6165:0x3cde9afdbc4225be,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She is a liability and should not handle patient medications.when i remember my experience with her i can't help but recall that she is a serious health hazard and should not be in medicine or customer service.
imam Muneera the pharmacist at this cvs called and ask me what color bottle the medication she filled just moments before (for my 8 month old baby) was in. She expressed uncertainty in what she gave my husband but told me that she should not have called me and quickly got off the phone when i tried to clear up what she meant by the question.
I was advised by two doctor's i spoke with to have her remix the medication to ensure its the proper medication and dosage so i asked her  to remix the medication because i was not comfortable giving it to my baby.
She became very abrasive and began to tell me that she was the pharmacist and she was sure that it was the right medication and she was not going to remix it. I expressed to her again that i would still like for her to remix it.
Dispite the fact that she made a mistake, she was very cocky and her demeanor was very confrontational and unprofessional. As the conversation progressed she told me i would have to pay out of pocket for another prescription and kept repeating that she was not going to remix it. When i informed her that the pharmacy tech spilled the medication she remixed it and shoved it towards me in a very aggressive manner with the label hanging off the bottle. I wasn't sure if she did remix it and she became very condescending after i told her that she was be hostile towards me. The last straw for me was when she said "" do you want it or not?""
I had to ask for a manager at that point and that's when Steve Muneera (he has the same last night as her so I'm not sure if he's her husband or a relative)  came to the drive through window and WITHOUT apology or acknowledgement of her behavior handed me the bottle.

The only thing they having going for them is the portion size, but does size matter when the food is mediocre? I usually get cheese steaks and they are average at best.

1: Waiters and Waitresses are attentive for ordering drinks but it is often 15 min+ before you actually get your drink. Not sure if it's the bar or what but it's just a beer.
2: On Monday nights they have a $2 off pints special. Every single time I've been there, my tab comes with a -$2 for the entire tab. I have to correct the server that it should be applied to each beer and then I get the ""Oh, sometimes the computer does that"". It happens every single time.

They are perfectly located close to Osage Beach, Ha Ha Tonka, and many other things to do. The facilities and campground where very clean and well stocked! What really set KOA aside from other places was the customer service. Anything we needed they accommodated. We had a late check in. The office was closed. Within 15 minutes of being there a gentleman came around and asked if we needed anything, helped us get plenty of firewood. You have to pay cash for the wood. We were short, and they just let us pay the balance the next day. They came and checked up on us the second day also bringing more firewood. I could not be more happy with our experience at KOA!

Mine was certainly unforgettable. Unforgivable also.

I  attempted to stay here with my service dog on October 4th 2015.  I was polite and cordial the whole time. I had a room reserved over the phone. When I arrived to check in and get my room keys with my service animal, Lexy. The owner of this establishment aggressively screamed at me to leave while barreling out of an office door towards me like he was going to attack me. I actually side stepped in an attempt to get out of his way and protect myself and Lexy. Jason, the guy behind the front desk who had been checking me in, was trying to neutralize things and help by finding another hotel,  The owner was so rude and blinded by anger, yelling at me that he screamed over me and Jason the entire 3 minuets of the  attack.  I would definitely call it an attack with how horrible he treated me. It was as if I broke something on purpose of his or stole money from him.  He threatened me and said that I'm trespassing, that it's private property.

She is not a pet, she is a service animal who alerts me to oncoming medical emergencies. Thank god I didn't have a medical emergency because of his  hysteria and hate directed towards me.  I tryed to  explain politely, but he wouldn't let me speak. He just kept saying how ""you people are what's wrong with America"" and how ""I chose to come there instead of every other hotel that allows pets in this town""  and that  ""why did I have to come to HIS hotel"". As if I had it out for him and was trying to hurt him!

I was half afraid that he was going to kick Lexy! I think there might be something wrong with him...

All other ""regular""  hotels in town were booked and I couldn't stay another night in a ""cabin style""  hotel because it was uninsulated and the heaters didn't work.

Once he opened the door and made me go outside, the old man continued to berate me  until I was crying. I couldn't think, I had to get away from him, and sat in my car for a half an hour trying to comprehend what just happened. He is an old man and I was a young lady, how could he think it  appropriate to scream at me?  Getting so close to my face that he was spitting on me and I had to continue to back up as he went on and on.  He was physically intimidating and  discriminatory.

They seem to think that if they found you another hotel to stay in, that it was OK for them to deny me.

Well he is gravely mistaken. He not only violated my civil rights that day but it is a crime, a misdemeanor in the state of Montana to deny a person with a disability and a service animal at their establishment.

I told him if I had had a different disability then diabetes I could've been on the floor convulsing because of how crazy he created the situation to be. and I said that he would've had to call an ambience. His response?........... "" I don't care!""

Needless to say, if you have a service animal do not go here until the federal courts punch this guy a new one.",,,0x534fd0c52c98cf1d:0xb41888c58e448a56,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My only complaint is the same complaint at other carwash, they need to turn the tire cleaner knob open just a hair more. Cause I’ve tried it a few times just standing there with tire clear going for a minute or two & nothing really seems to come out...

Apart from that my overall experience is always good. Times I’ve been there, it was never to busy so one doesn’t have to wait very long or not at all. There is a automatic carwash but I’ve never used it & credit cards are excepted in each stall. There are only two vacuums & a vending machine around back for your air fresheners, shammies, glass wipes & tire wipes.",[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPILYImzjtWcGRTKLiUJzGNHi22Ur0nxxplUsHe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}],,0x53487d07b79beae1:0x9fd7a5f53eb9cf77,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Foaming soap brush actually foams up a ton and doesn't sputter out, and sprays (tire/bug/wax/etc) all do as they should. Only wish they had better vacuums/attachments, but otherwise great place.

This place is huge, and has some great deals on games certain days of the week.
The one thing I didn't like was the excessive number of visits from several staff asking if we were okay, then are you still okay, do you need anything, are you still okay... etc... not just our server, but 3 different people came by all asking the same things repeatedly in our hour and a half... having good customer service is important but over-doing it can be intrusive too and super annoying)
There seemed to be at least 5 too many workers on our floor for the middle of the day. They looked bored and were just standing around huddled up talking. I imagine this is why we had so many visits.
The menu: I ordered fries and  spinach artichoke dip & chips. The dip n chips were good, a lil pricey- but atleast good and the  fries were way overpriced...
. It was $4 for what would equal a medium fry at any random fast food place.
I would absolutely go back with a group, just hope we wont have so many interruptions with the workers next time and I may have to eat before I go.",[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoufJE6Fi-EDaNdCmVNaHpU79vtXTBG0PHuMSq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}],"{'time': 1580298563283, 'text': ""Thanks for the great review, Yvonne!

She even made time to answer any of the questions we had to ask. I would highly recommend Lizz to anyone that goes to this location.,,"{'time': 1577802937060, 'text': 'Thanks for the great review, Nina!

This place is huge, and has some great deals on games certain days of the week.
The one thing I didn't like was the excessive number of visits from several staff asking if we were okay, then are you still okay, do you need anything, are you still okay... etc... not just our server, but 3 different people came by all asking the same things repeatedly in our hour and a half... having good customer service is important but over-doing it can be intrusive too and super annoying)
There seemed to be at least 5 too many workers on our floor for the middle of the day. They looked bored and were just standing around huddled up talking. I imagine this is why we had so many visits.
The menu: I ordered fries and  spinach artichoke dip & chips. The dip n chips were good, a lil pricey- but atleast good and the  fries were way overpriced...
. It was $4 for what would equal a medium fry at any random fast food place.
I would absolutely go back with a group, just hope we wont have so many interruptions with the workers next time and I may have to eat before I go.",[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMoufJE6Fi-EDaNdCmVNaHpU79vtXTBG0PHuMSq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}],"{'time': 1580298563283, 'text': ""Thanks for the great review, Yvonne!

Miss Molly Cantrell is the sweetest most helpful person I came across during my hectic wedding prep season. She is kind and understanding and ever so helpful.

She will listen to your needs and is super accomodative. The prices are so worth it. The location will give great photos. You dont have to spend on decor or flowers as it is already decorated and very pretty.

The purple stained glass behind the alter will give great photos.
There are 2 great salons just a hop skip and a jump away and their prices are reasonable too.
This chapel has very lovely dressing grooms - separate for bride & groom. The bride's room has items of vintage charm.

Above all Molly will give you the confidence you need to ease off any tension with her fabulous support!
My partner & I recommend Brownstone Chapel... Look no further ! You will fall in love with this chapel.

Thank you Molly for your wonderful support!",,,0x8651fe1027b1be2b:0x5b58b3948e395554,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most you are just another patient and you feel the ‘NEXT’ sign looming over your head (like a failed audition).
But I once again trusted in the reviews to give this doctor a chance.

I can tell you that Dr Ruth is by far one of the BEST DOCTOR EXPERIENCES I HAVE HAD since my late teens and early 20s. I’m in my 40s and she is AMAZING!! She’s professional and thorough. I know as her practice grows she will have more pressures on time but I hope she holds onto her base of practices. This is what stands her out from the rest. This has been MY ABSOLUTE FIRST doctor that ACTUALLY LISTENED!!!!! to my concerns and didn’t brush them off. (Side note: to be fair- I did encounter a male doctor similar to her in Austin Tx- however I was only out there temporarily on a work assignment so couldn’t continue to see him. Now back). Dr Ruth targeted each concern!!!!!! And addressed each one!!!!!! With answers and test for the ones they may needed confirmation. She was so thorough in her exam explaining the whys and connections.

I tell you I was so so so impressed with Dr Ruth’s Knowledge. It’s evident she’s a doctor to help people and takes her skills snd knowledge seriously!!

She went over my test results with me and do you know this is the first in about 15 years I got answers or at least an idea as to what’s possibly happening to me. I tell you I can cry writing this article. I walked out of her office in peace with my body and was able to breathe for the first time knowing i don’t have elements happening to me that could shut me down in severe illness or expire me. And she didn’t make me feel like there’s nothing happening to me or I’m crazy or just brush off my concern like the others have ALWAYS DONE!!!! I actually NOW know what’s happening to me every month. Thank you so so much Dr Ruth. Now at least I know what I’m being treated for. Wow.. it took me 15 years to find a great doctor that cares even about what may seem like the little stuff.

To give kudos to her amazing staff. I love Dr Ruth’s assistant. Such a beautiful soul. And the front desk ladies are always kind, easy to talk to and professional. You will not be disappointed with this location. Mansfield needed a doctor like this. Ive been starting to consider traveling  to Southlake/ Colleyville and Frisco to find the great doctors. I am so happy there’s finally one in my home town. I wish their were more Doctors like this in all areas of treatment.",,,0x864e61589b70797f:0x9b37ed202eb9980,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My friend and I ordered ceramic pieces to paint October 23 of 2020 and scheduled the class to paint them for the morning of November 7. November 6 rolls around and at 7:45 that evening I get a text from Stacie that my truck had not come in and that it would not be in until that Monday. She promised to give me a $10 credit (never received) for my trouble and I told her it was no big deal! So we rescheduled for mid December.
We show up for the class and Stacie tells us “would y’all like the good news or bad news?” Oh boy. She goes on to explain that my truck was STILL not there, and my friend’s tree was completely shattered..a phone call would have been great so I wouldn’t have to waste an hour and a half round trip drive! She told us we could wait for the next shipment to come in, use our credit for another class, or get a refund. Us, trying to be supportive and understanding during this unprecedented time, wanted to give this business yet another chance to make things right so we agreed to wait it out for a bit longer. I did ask Stacie that if we still had not received our pieces by Christmas if we could call back and get our refund to which she said yes.

Fast forward to early January. Still ZERO communication so I called Stacie for my refund. She said she would not do that because the pieces had already been ordered, yet still had not arrived. That’s not what she said in person but okay? 😂 So here we are today, nearing February. Still nothing. No phone call, no message, nada. I’m sure I’ll never see that money again or the truck I was supposed to receive, but at this point it’s just about principle. As a small business owner i think you should treat customers better than this.
Do yourself a favor and go to Cloth and Glaze at Alliance. They had the exact pieces we wanted in stock and treated us how people deserve to be treated",,,0x864dd803adae9601:0x25a24bdbb067b8a5,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But the price of a new tire was so high. I decided to go somewhere else that's when he said hold up we might have one let me make a call. I'm thinking they was bringing one from another shop cause he had made it very clear they don't keep used tires there. And it was one there from the beginning. For 35$ and he was trying to charge us 145$ for a new one. Smh.,,,0x8627d72c772df6ff:0x8590eee52a7b6655,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I  went inside and told the Quik Tripper employee, at the cash register my problem, she asked another Quik Tripper employee, to go out to my gas pump location and help me. You are so right about your Quik Tripper employees. They greet you with a  smile, and are very eager to help you.

That was the kinda of service I received at Quik Trip #197, excellent customer service with a smile, and in a very professional  environment. That's why I'm  now a return customer at Quik Trip #197.",,,0x87c0c299bda0f78b:0xafb2a3962b8a3afb,,,,,,,,,,,,,
