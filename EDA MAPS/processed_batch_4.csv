I had to track down somebody to speak to about this as nobody was in the countertop area.  I went across the street to request assistance.  Maybe this business could benefit in implementing a way for them to know a customer is waiting?

It is important to note that both employees I spoke with were helpful, cordial, and friendly.  I will update this review in a few weeks when my order is finished to review the finished product.

Okay,  so I picked up the finished product, but I was late in doing so.  I was promptly waited on upon my return and am happy both with the quality of work and the price we worked out.",,,0x8839dc2ddf4a9203:0xc29b4c5507c7fa87,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is not what happened. Logan from Asurion was great, but he was a shining star amongst black holes. The award for worst customer service ever goes to (AT&T on Piedmont). These guys lied to me on multiple occasions, sent me away to chase down false leads, and provided me with minimal help because I wasn't there to make them commission. Again, I feel like I have to say this twice; this was the worst experience I've ever had, and I am a very laid back individual who hardly ever gets upset. I actually think this is the 1st negative review I've ever written, but it's definitely well deserved. The AT&T on 2561 Piedmont Road NE in Atlanta GA, should be closed down for good or the employees there should be replaced. They are the type of employees that kill a companies good reputation.

I had problems with the phone, the swype text didn't work well at all and I had problems with the GPS so I took it back. They said that the GPS worked the 1 time they tested it and swype text not working doesn't mean there is a problem with the phone so they charged me $35 to return the phone. I took that as time to part ways with AT&T. I've had 2 other phones where swype text works perfectly so it's either a problem with the phone or a problem with the phone's programming, either way it didn't work properly and they would not budge on screwing me out of money for nothing.

Knowledgeable, trustworthy, fair-dealing, and truly welcoming of my business. I first came to him 12 years ago on recommendation from a friend who drove his suburban around the country 50-60,000 miles a year for his business, and so he had to have a reliable mechanic looking out for him on those long trips. He counted on Pete to help him get 250,000 RELIABLE miles or more out of his vehicles. I have had the same experience, and these guys do more than just transmissions. If he can do it well, he will. If your issue means you would be better off taking it elsewhere, he will tell you AND help you find somebody good to handle it. Pete has also given me much good advice over the years about what to do and what NOT to do, when it comes to service on several vehicles but I have entrusted to his care. Lastly, Eileen does a great job handling the financials and customer service. When I call, she has it rigged so she is already looking at my history, knows my vehicles, and makes it very personal and efficient.",,,0x880f9286b35b7c51:0x5d92e9d13eb1fe0f,,,,,,,,,,,,,

104789677913629612111,Bobbie Jo Ng,1549593182668.0,1.0,"The owner of this company is rude and an I want to say numerous other things but I will not stop to his level of education..

First and foremost he is giving Lex Brodies a bad name. If this is how Lex Brodie's allow their name to be represented I will discontinue all services and with this company and any  businesses affiliated with this name. Mind you I have been a faithful participant and believer of Lex Brodies and their services for over 15 years.

I purchased the monthly express car wash pass because I thought I'd give it a try but they want to put a sticker on my car. I do not mark my car in anyway and the sticker would be placed on my tint. So upon purchasing the services I told them that and the manager at the time told me it was alright but if the chip in the sticker broke I would have to pay 2 dollars to replace (I was ok with). So I have been going there for about a month. Today there was issues with the scan bar thing. The owner comes out with a chip on his should and starts speaking to me really condescending like I'm an idiot. I told him that they do not pay me to advertise for them on my car one and they did not pay for the rent on my car because the sticker will go on my tint. Which if they pull off will peel my tint. And he got really cocky and told me he is the owner and he makes the rules and he will do what he wants. I told him that I do not mark my car with any thing because that will allow people to know my car which in Hilo u have to be careful especially with the high theft that's been going on. So he tells me that hes cancelling my membership because not putting the sticker on adds more work to them because they have to verify the sticker to the plates of my vehicle because I am able to pass the sticker on to others.. let's just say all the workers there knows my car and me because that is how many times I have gone there. The owner has horrible customer service. He would not try to find a solution to my dilemma or assist me in anyway. He needs to get a clue in customer service and be educated in the worst way on how to speak to people.

Did not give this guy any service because he does not even try to help.. it's his way or the highway..",,"{'time': 1556323035852, 'text': ""Sorry for your encounter with our Company Manager.

We've been here a few times, and it's one of my favorite haunts for business dinners, and we've always been pleased. Our most recent visit was for a date night with the wife and I enjoyed my typical lobster dish and my wife had the kebab trio. Unfortunately the trio came out a bit cold, but once we let the waiter know they resolved the situation far faster than we expected and took such good care of us we nearly forgot the incident all together.

Despite this one issue we've always head a great time at this place, it's a wonderful slightly upscale but still cozy restaurant, offers great menu choices and has phenomenal quality. We love going here, will certainly back and I highly recommend you check it out if you're in the Rhode Island area. It's definitely worth a bit of a drive.",,,0x89e5b34f7f2e70e9:0x9d5fa61c51bf01f7,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The young man by the front door handling shopping carts was rude to me when I tried to take a cart from the entrance he was nasty and glared when I was just trying to get one shopping cart. As someone who has worked in customer service his attitude and lack of professionalism negatively affected my shopping experienxe and my opinion of Smith's. They need to retain their staff on basic customer service skills. If a customer is trying to take a shopping cart common courtesy says you give them a cart and don't argue with customers or talk badly about them which he did. I will probably shop either Albertsons or Safeway next time I'm in Bozeman as their staff is much friendlier and helpful.

So to get rid of it took it back and got a 2008 only had it 3 weeks and it just stopped on Dewey in rush hour.  So pushed it to time saver. They had it towed. Called Zellers and because I drove it 1 day in 4 wheel drive, they said that they couldn't help me. I believe that if you are going to promote your business as a Christian that you should be honest about what is wrong with the vechile you are buying. And I know that as is means as is. But it s hould run more than 3 weeks. I really thought that they were a reputable business. Fooled me.

The best thing to say about this place is that the staff was super friendly, but after that not great.  The fried rice was odd and bland. The orange chicken was very bland too. The pork teriyaki was typical. The chicken teriyaki was also pretty standard or so we thought until my son spent the next 24 hours with food poisoning. He was the only one who ate the chicken teriyaki and since we were traveling it was easy to isolate who ate what and which foods were eaten by more than one person.

I had to email to complain because they don't answer their phone! I got the response  that they train their employees to not comment or make adjustments to the student's appearance so they feel comfortable and parents are encouraged to volunteer so they can make the adjustments.

The location of The Scarlet is close to campus, in the dire need that your student might need to walk to class.  The facilities include locked gates, which help to deter undesired trespassers.  Apartments are good, and the management works hard to keep the needs of the tenants met.  Covered parking is an option for an additional fee.  And the grounds are monitored regularly, especially on game days.

112381810387831913042,Jaime Reyes,1485716013207.0,5.0,"I'm really impressed with this apartment complex. My townhouse is really nice and the area is great.
Don't have problems with the internet yet as everyone is saying, thank god. maybe they fixed it? Also, distance to campus is pretty nice, and it's a nice area.

Update 3.0 (Feb 1, 2017): The clubhouse is finally open and is 24 hours with coffee, free printing, and a great gym. It's nice! Apartment is great as well. I can finally give this place 5 stars. Not bad once everything is working like it's supposed to.

Update 1.5: The clubhouse is still not done and it's kinda frustrating to see the skeleton of the clubhouse while management is saying it's gonna be completed by thanksgiving break.
I don't know if that's going to happen. i haven't seen anyone work on it at all. The ""finish date"" is set before thanksgiving, however it's 10/31/16 and the foundation is still visible. I'm not a manager of this construction project however, at this rate i don't believe this clubhouse will be finished for the projected date. It's increasingly becoming a pain.

Update 2: random charges are frequently becoming  common, these include a 50 dollar account processing fee which is also known as a ""Fee on top of a fee"" because we're paying for some random 3rd company to process the complexes accounts, IMO this fee should have been waived in consideration of the LENGTH of my INABILITY to utilize the Clubhouse which is included on top of our fees that we pay, but that's just me.
Also weird utility overages from across complexes are present. In comparison to the amount of energy used, kWH, and the price per unit of energy, apartment renters are seeing anywhere between a 20-50 dollar overage this past month alone. In my situation it's around 22 dollars, and that's because we replaced all the bulbs in the house and have the AC set to 78 when we're not home.
When questioned about this anomaly, management referred us to LPL, upon contact with the company, we were informed that our apartment utility is not under our name and thus there was nothing we can do about it.

Conclusively, if you already have signed a lease or thinking about signing a lease, know that you will need to add about 20-50 dollars extra upon the rent quote management gives you.
And if a representative tries to tell you that the 90-120 dollar cap is enough for utilities, know that they are lying.

105871598480442448605,travis,1535669706968.0,1.0,"When I first moved in the place was absolutely disgusting. Dirt everywhere, dog fur in places I didn't think possible, and just overall the worst possible scenario for an apartment. After contacting management, they sent over a cleaning crew, which was the loudest excuse for a cleaning crew I've ever heard of. The cleaners consisted of 2 people with a couple bottles of windex and other assorted sprays, and a couple of dirty looking rags. Needless to say they accomplished nothing. After the useless cleaners left, my parents and I, instead of moving my stuff into my new place, spent the next 4 hours doing the cleaners job. But that is where the negative ends. The head property manager Kendra was very helpful and had everything in my apartment replaced, including the carpet. I was very pleased with the quick service and helpful people at the front desk. Barring the state of the building upon my arrival I would give this place a very good review.

Update: against my better judgement I renewed my lease for the 2017-2018 school year. Again the apartment was dirty upon moving in. The sink had a leak, the area under the sink had mold and the wood was rotten from the leak, the water heater barely worked at all, and our door had obvious signs of having been kicked in while the previous tenant was present. Additionally, both the washer and dryer needed to be replaced. All of this took 2 months to get done with more hassle and headaches than I care to mention. The office staff doesnt keep the gates closed, so random people can walk or drive in whenever they please. The pool area is closed way more than it is open. Of the last 8 times I have tried to use the pool or hot tub, the gates were inexplicably locked even though I was well within the normal use times that are posted on a sign nearby. One time I actually bothered to ask the management why the  pool  was closed. Their response was that they had to renew the pool permit. Seems to me like they forgot to renew the permit earlier, and the people paying for the pool (us, the tenants) got screwed over again. Of the last 8 times that I tried to use the pool it was closed 5 of them. I would say that this is what I get for going someplace cheap, but the rent is no less than the much nicer surrounding communities. Avoid this place like the plague it is.

Also, dont forget the pot holes that are so big that they could swallow a small car if you arent careful.",,"{'time': 1473713051996, 'text': ""Hi Travis, we're so sorry to hear about your experience at move-in, but we're glad that our staff was able to assist you.

Though not as rich as some other ramen (like 14 hour broth/tonkatsu pork broth), it comes with fried onions which adds flavor.  We ordered the spicy Shoyu (I added an egg and corn), and the waitress correctly graded it as 3/10 spicy.  We added some chili powder, but next time I might try the spice bomb for an extra dollar.

Bailey is now doing very well.  Thank you Dr. Harvey and staff!

111614815258510664927,Buffy Wingo,1479839560515.0,1.0,"Last week we dealt with an extremely rude employee and the manager we finally talked to wasn't much better. She shorted us one cup and then gave us a hard time about getting another cup. One drink was a water, so she forgot to give a cup for water. She also did not give us two other items we ordered and demanded to see our receipt for proof and acted as though she was mad that we were correct. We finally got the manager on duty over to us to get us the stuff we were missing as the cashier just walked away from us. When we explained to the manager what had happened, the cashier was very ugly and snapped that she told us to wait. The manager made no apologies and didn't seem to care. A very nice lady who was helping in the drive thru came over and assisted us in getting the rest of our order. Our order was a little over $50 so I understand them forgetting a few items, but the rudeness over her mistake was so unnecessary. We also had a coupon for 6 free nuggets that my niece got from school for good grades, but the cashier said it couldn't be used at this store as it said to be used in any of the 45 counties around the metro atlanta area. Why would mcdonalds give out coupons to schools if the coupons can't even be used in the area?  It's got to be disappointing to the children who earned them. Seems like a pretty mean thing to do to children.  I was shocked by just how negatively we were treated.",,,0x888aa31d2f165843:0x9b3bd7d8285acc3a,,,,,,,,,,,,,
113084976152707660718,Mike King,1522045884023.0,2.0,This Mcdonalds has horrible customer service especially at night ive been there on more than one occasion when they have had the entire restraunt at a standstill where u couldnt order from the drive-thru speaker. You have to go to the window where they take your order onto a piece of paper then from that point they have to tell the workers how to cook your food which typically takes about 20 to 30 min per customer and this goes for the inside as well. Then u can only pay with cash in which they calculated your total somehow from their phone as well as the amount of change u recieve and the food is just horrible. I spent almost an hour trying to get a McChicken and a Mcdouble and then they left off the cheese on the Mcdouble and my McChicken was so bad I couldnt eat but a bite or two and had to throw it away.,,,0x888aa31d2f165843:0x9b3bd7d8285acc3a,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not only have I *watched* entire grooming processes, but I've also seen the care and diligence of the owners and staff members. They are friendly and lighthearted, but take some matters very seriously (illness, injuries, or improper care). They not only only offer skilled grooming, but also great care for boarders, and amazing insight into what clients are looking for in canine nutrition! Sophia and Davidson are also amazing stewards to the community... Offering to foster a wide array of dogs and assisting the local shelters when they can. If my dogs had thumbs, they'd be giving them a huge thumbs up  ",,,0x88d0d94f956cfc0f:0xda20b26f5606dd42,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lilly, my Pomeranian Everglades Red Fox Service Dog, has a double coat of hair on that cute little body.  Sophia is the only groomer who said Not to cut short, but to trim and Concentrate on De-thatching(my word) her thick undercoat. I believe Lilly's ITCHY backside is due to nerves growing back from large cyst removal from mid- back.  Sophia said Lilly's skin looks great.  No hot spots, either. Don't be surprised when you walk through the door and a tall Afghan Hound has his front paws up on the gate, smiling at you. I swear...he looked just like a cartoon Network character!!  You can also use Dogs En Vogue as a doggie day care or boarding. I noticed one owner dropping his dog off one day each week for a chance to relax away from each other a little bit and to be able to play with some doggie friends.  Nice change of pace for everyone!!",,"{'time': 1537587588925, 'text': 'Vicki, thank you so much for trusting us with Lilly.

Add a vending machine with reasonably-priced candy, a FREE book borrowing program, plenty of shade, free WiFi, a water fountain, nice staff, a separate play & pool area for younger kids, and a separate adults-only pool and you've got Wisehaven! We love this place. They have movies on Friday nights and other fun events like storytime etc. The parking lot is kind of small but we always find a spot. They also have tennis and basketball, and they show cartoons on their TVs in the main food area. The building itself has a few cracks here or there, but the issue is only cosmetic and not a big deal. It's actually very well maintained. You can sign your kids up for 1 on 1 swim lessons pretty inexpensively. They even have tennis lessons here, too.

110468384078294320065,Andrew D.,1621824571434.0,5.0,My review is for the accessibility of the facility. My 97 year old father-in-law was invited to a wedding at Wrights. He is in a wheelchair. There is convenient handicapped parking. It's level paved ground to the door with no steps.  The bathroom is almost perfect. My only suggestion for improvement would be that it's hard to reach the soap from a wheelchair. There is plenty of room in the handicap stall and you can roll up to the sink. The staff was friendly and helpful. I pushed his wheelchair down the gravel road to the waterfall ceremony area but could have driven him there to a drop off spot. A side note for me was that the food was good. Overall the accessibility was really excellent and I highly recommend them for an event.,"[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2zzQerNPwjM29f30zgVKFDDt-rirnHPLkgWon=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmCyV1DH1DuFSFzTtSWi4rtWs-fi1WLehrS8ks=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOCb1_6t6Vqve2vaN_Z0ZWYkJS493HCQ4oxwcTZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuVQ8QTgsMo-ZYQumBJHZx5j8ikOZV5VEG3d4B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]","{'time': 1621894334469, 'text': 'Thank you'}",0x89e680863ba27aeb:0xaecd7400f2f212d1,,,,,,,,,,,,,

100362141406062265151,Truthfully Tara,1608561283730.0,2.0,"Placed an order for furniture 4 months ago as Christmas Surprises for my children one being my college student, it was to be delivered in Nov. while she was home on Winter Recess no call from the company stating the furniture would not be available or in stock on stated time frame ( Nov. 23). I reached out to Darvin and was notified the expected arrival date would be mid Dec.. Needless to say as of Dec. 21 no furniture no call with updates so I called to see if it would be delivered before Christmas to be told the delivery is now expected late January. Not only is the Christmas/ Holiday surprise ruined....My college young adult leaves beginning  of January so she won't get a chance to see her new furniture. Terribly disappointed although I know things are a bit different with less staff, etc...I would have expected the furniture by now and updates for good customer service. I had already cancelled one order because it was taking longer than expected. The second order was ordered 4 to 5 months ago. Not one call of customer service nor updates provided.

We're incredibly appreciative of the feedback we receive from our customers, and we're happy to see you had a positive experience. You are correct; unfortunately, there have been an unprecedented volume of interruptions in production and the supply chain over the last year, and that has made it difficult for many manufacturers to provide the inventory to our warehouse. However, we do have lamps, other accessories, and furniture in all categories that are available for purchase--ready to be taken home from our warehouse or delivered within the week. Most of our merchandise falls under this category, as we do not sell furniture off the floor at this time (with the exception of our clearance merchandise). If you have any questions or if there is anything we can do to make your next visit an even better one, please feel encouraged to reach out to us at (708) 460-4100 :)""}",0x880e3f87c42218c5:0x94c6be324893694,,,,,,,,,,,,,

-Menu. Just the right size. Because they don't have to worry about keeping so many things onhand, they can pay more attention to detail and therefore make higher quality food. Absolutely DELICIOUS in fact. :)
-Atmosphere. Lighting is PERFECT. Many places like to keep it freezing, the temperature I find here to be just right. It makes me comfortable, and honestly want to stay longer and eat more. Good choice of music, classical is calming and fits the place, pop music just does not work in this kind of setting.
-Staff. I do not know the inner workings of the staff, but I can not tell you how many times I have heard arguing in the kitchen or amongst employees at other places. It makes me feel very uncomfortable. It is a relief that the staff does not behave this way, even if they honestly don't like each other, I would never know because they don't drag it into work. My previous favorite sushi place was guilty of this, and honestly the bubbly and polite waiter is what had kept me going back, til he disappeared. As for Tiger Sushi's waiter, he is polite, courteous, attentive, has a great smile, and just gives off the vibe of being a very good person. I feel cared for when I eat here and not unwanted, and like having him around.

Everything about Tiger Sushi works in its favor and I will continue wanting more and more. Thank you so very, very VERY much for the excellent experience!!! <3",,,0x8626bb49acb34b91:0xa7c0a7843513f56,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Everyone was friendly and helpful. This is a great venue for the kids and even adults. The whole family will have a great time and the entertainers are great at making the crowed a part of the show. I was able to see the Christmas special for the first time. You might not think pirates and Christmas go together but Dolly has managed to integrate the two wonderfully. My two year old nephew loved it! They have birds, camels, sea lions, and even a huge seal! The performers are well trained and will keep you entertained throughout your dinner and show. As a kid I grew up getting to see the Dixie Stampede which in my opinion was a little better. Being in a coastal community I understand why Dolly changed it to a pirate themed show. This is a must while you are visiting the beach for the kids, it's an experience they won't forget.  Be sure to get there early to see the pre show it was a lot of fun...and right next to the bar for the adults!",[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyvlYGw0X3I1V86f_ZRTKH3aXhq9SaWOGb35Ud=w150-h150-k-no-p']}],,0x890065bb3423c8f1:0xf01120ee3d1f827a,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They really are incredibly good and I almost always end up going for the ""guest"" burger. This time it was venison. I got it because I've only ever really had venison in other things, not just as ground meat or steak. I'll admit that it wasn't my favorite, but I blame the meat, not the chef. It was still delicious, but I liked the Elk more.

They also have a great option of doing two sliders instead, so you can sample it without committing to it completely.

Their baked fries and yam fries are very good. You don't miss the frying at all. The other sides are great, too. This time it was a cooked green, kale and another, and it was amazing.

Special this day. Elk burger topped with blue berry compote. What could go wrong? Nearly every thing. Remember the milk shake? It was good. The blueberry jam was too thick and too sweet. Seems that someone there tries to do gourmet meals with little experience in that direction.

I would have had better luck with the choices had I studied the menu instead of doing the special. Meat was tough, rubbery and quite cold. Perhaps the compote was not heated. Side salad that came with mine was mostly a large bunch of carrots, ultra thinly sliced with fennel seeds mixed in and a dressing that never made an appearance.

I asked one of the workers if we could open one of their windows in the front you can see in the picture but he said they couldn't (weird cause it's up in the picture).

If you can handle it, you've gotta try the torta Ahogada. Apparently it means drowning, as in drowning in sauce, but I would also say when you eat this you are drowning in meat! It's like a very large Mexican sloppy joe, but so much more delicious. It is covered in sauce so they literally give you gloves to eat it with!! Hibiscus juice is also yum. I hear they have good margaritas too but I haven't had a chance to try them.

Staff is always helpful and friendly. I think it's not as hard to get a table here as maybe it once was. I delayed coming here for a while because I thought of it as super crowded but the last two times I have been we have not had trouble getting a table.

105313570492749206679,Jeigh Tushick,1585554822754.0,5.0,"Virtually impossible to compare any other car wash in town, by leveraging your ability to self service detail the interior with their FREE vacuums and rug (carpet cleaner - dry roller brushes that centrifugally rotate with semi hard bristles)  you can quickly detail your own vehicle all at the cost of your own polishing chemicals found here at your community stores.

The exterior non-touchless car was is partially manned and automated. Offering several packaged, you can save yourself the time (not money) on the extras like wheel cleaners, tireshine, and spray on wax.

As Seth mentioned, there's no need for the hand dry finish, especially at the cost of scuffed up finish on your car due to debris in the drying towels.

Look no further for a price point of less than a few fast food visits for an entire month worth of unlimited car washes. Cut out fast food and see your car shine instead.

There are several other places who will do a full interior and exterior detailing job with professional orbital buffers, depending on the oxidation, impurities, and other factors that come into play..they'll charge you an arm and a leg..

So it's easy.. invest in the subscription monthly package (cancel anytime just like Netflix)and u can upgrade for half price once a month for one dollar to cover the under carriage. This all depends on your driving and conditions, with road salt causing oxidation to accelerate rustinfg... it'd important to keep this from happening with wash and waxes on a regular basis. (Also another line of defense against rocks)

The more you can slow down your amortization from depreciation (your vehicle, the better your life will be. If it's within budget and a great fit for your vehicle, which it definitely is (especially with their expanding locations).

I would recommend a detailing shop right South if town that will do an amazing job in full detailing of your vehicle, combined you have an infinitely valuable product and service here.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMW2cJ4Glbv5tT5E4TM1HsgZZ0AEMEjuc7ty14-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOByJ7lulI59jEBDoygsQCTIn0ClSoOHuYsjDC6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpXlbIaEV0EEu7Z0gUFy7CLZFvcYL-ZyEmgt9c=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSitwG8vUg9k8KXcB79cawpdMIPPBqeofIHpGU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",,0x8796966c00000001:0x824195a7fb665531,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nothing is obstructed since it is located in the tallest building in downtown, Seattle. We have been here several times and everyone we've spoken to is very friendly and knowledgeable. And if they aren't, they find the right people who can help you. They throw some really great events that I would highly recommend checking out such as Pride events, 4th of July, yoga, Sunset experiences, etc. The events get pretty busy and packed but if you go on any regular day, the views are breathtaking and it's rather tranquil. They also have fun games like Connect Four if you just want to sit and take in the views. Regardless, definitely a place to check out with the whole family or a perfect place for date night!",,,0x54906ab0c78fe38b:0x7788956a51c230f5,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There isn't much seating though and the interior of the observation deck wasn't as nice as the Space Needle. The Space Needle had interactive maps that pointed out areas of interest as well as fun facts, but the Sky View observatory just had a few facts on the dimly lit walls.

I highly appreciate that the annual pass is still around $100--the same price as before. Though I live out of state now, I might pick up an annual pass! One trip up is worth it for $20. If you're gonna be back 4 times in a year (and you should if you're living in the area), get the pass.
