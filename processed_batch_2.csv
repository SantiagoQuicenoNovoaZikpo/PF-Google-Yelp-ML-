Very popular, especially by young people, the restaurant has excellent prices and fast and punctual service.
Don't be fooled by the Japanese on the Strip, look for alternatives a few minutes by car from the big hotels, it will be worth it and your wallet will thank you.

Buon giapponese a Town Square, con menù lungo (forse troppo) e abbondanza di rolls (anche vegetariani e con pesce cotto).
Molto frequentato, soprattutto da giovani, il ristorante ha ottimi prezzi e servizio rapido e puntuale.

113274986656975288538,Alison M,1583858661392.0,5.0,"This is my favorite hotel in all the world.  Probably because it's in Hawaii and probably because of the amazing location right beside the beach, but either way.  There you have it.

From the friendly and affectionate greeting upon arrival with a cool drink, cool towel and a beautiful floral lei, to the room that opened to the ocean and pool area, to the days spent lounging and enjoying sunshine and sea turtles, there is nothing not to love.

The golf course is interesting and has black lava rock areas that give it a neat visual appeal - there is a walking trail to one of the beach clubs where you can surf and check out snorkel gear.

I fed the large sting ray inside the adventure pond with a bunch of kids for my birthday and enjoyed all the pools - there are several.

Food here is excellent - with poke, nightly specials, sushi, and wonderful desserts served at the main restaurant just steps from the ocean.  I loved their morning smoothies and bowls.

There is a trading post on site for bug spray, snacks, cookies, sunscreen and other sundries should you need them.  That place also has breakfast wraps, acai bowls and more if you don't want to eat every day at the main hotel restaurant.

I had a spa treatment for my birthday here in the traditional Hawaiian massage technique outside listening to the waves by a friendly and engaging lady who gave me tons of advice for where to go when we went on a later coffee tour.

It is set back a bit but with a rental car you can go one way to black sand beaches, exploration and the Kings and Queens shops if you want to purchase some fancy art or jewelry for yourself.  The gift shop on site is also well stocked with plenty of pretty items.

The other direction will take you into town for lunch.

I like that there is no parking fee if you self park and it's completely free.",,"{'time': 1583887594896, 'text': 'Aloha Alison,\n\nMahalo for giving us such an amazing review!

It's easily interpreted as the presentation is chronological from the top down (4th floor has the oldest art). It starts with mostly Dutch artists working in Britain, but soon progresses to the great 18th Century British artists such as Gainsborough, Reynolds, and Turner. The portraits are fantastic, as are the 19th Century landscapes. There are even modern artists occupying a fair space of the museum, most of which I didn't understand, but I did like the David Hockley stuff. A number of wonderful busts were also presented, mostly of antiquity or the 18th Century. Staff was helpful, the building is interesting, and the gift shop is good, too. All of this is free due to the largess of Paul Mellon, who also bequeathed money to the Yale University Art Museum across the street.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHKKS5JcBaIBcnhqJWnk2ZShD71-DQ0rAeo5-g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3ljYPV98TebiUIrT2lqdTkN6qDthFJfhDvA_j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",,0x89e7d9b3233f5e5b:0x5cbc2592481f14f0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I ordered my food 2 meals of  2 fish 2 chicken dinners. He kept asking what my sides were going to be i told him 5 times. Finally he got it right . i drove to the window paid and waited for 15 mins. When i got my food i checked in the bag, i was missing a dinner. Another worker came  to the window a few minutes later. I told her what we were missing. She said no your not Turned around and dug in the trash can, pulling out a receipt wich was not ours . she argued and was extreamly rude. Finally the man that took our order came back over.  I told him the same as i told her ! He gave me a rude comment and finally my husband stepped in showed him our recipt . he told us we were lying and refused us a meal even with the proof of the recipt.arguing then with my husband , Finally with the line backing up and us refusing to move he  threw our meal out the window to us. Never apologizing. And come to find out the 2 that were waiting on us were the managers. First off the female never washed her hands after digging in the trash touching food like its no big deal.  Even after all the fight we put up for a 30.00 bill it was not very good. I will say the mac and cheese was the best part.",,,0x8841c70741afc6ed:0xd49f03a5614f4c34,,,,,,,,,,,,,

101519833158093230083,Michael Thorburn,1560395364216.0,1.0,"Danny Deweese in the service department provides zero service. I brought my 4 Runner in with a nail in the tire and have a tire warranty that I purchased with the vehicle. I have had multiple tires replaced in Clearwater, FL and Greenville, SC and the services reps at these dealerships were able to figure out it out without anything from me. They also were able to provide me the warranty repair free of charge on the frontend while they were reimbursed on the backend. Fred Anderson does not offer this service because of many mishaps in the past and getting burned. While this is understandable as the customer it’s not my fault that this has happened in the past nor do I really care. But ok so I’ll do the backend rebate and the paperwork myself. What irritated me even more was the fact Danny told me it would be $25 to patch the tire but charged me $42.95. He called that a tax to the insurance company for his time because he had to sit on the phone for 30 min trying to figure out which insurance company I had when I purchased the vehicle. Funny thing is who pays the “time tax” for Danny just doing his job? I do. Then I have to hope I get reimbursed by the insurance company and wait 30+ days to get the check. I told him I want to be charged the $25 and he said nope that was the fee for his time. I’d love to know what Danny makes an hour that makes his time while he does his job so valuable.

The stylist had glasses, and green tips in her hair, and I believe her name was Michelle. When I arrived for my appointment, she sat me down and I told her how I normally get my hair cut, and after I told her she kept saying that it was impossible to do the hard part in my hairline, with no guard blend on the sides like i have always gotten at this location by the awesome Male barber, and others. She started cutting and was done within not even 10 minutes, rushed through the entire cut and came off very rude while trying to start conversation, making it one of the most uncomfortable & quickest haircuts I ever experienced . I had her try to touch up a few spots, and after she put product in, I thought it looked okay, until I washed my hair the next day and realized how many spots were missed or left uncut. I stopped in Sunday on my way into work, and politely asked the lady at the desk if I could get a touch up, in which the same lady that did my hair came out to fix it, and again was very rude and seemed annoyed that I asked for it too be fixed. While she was cutting again I thanked her for fixing it and she said nothing back the first time. At no time was I rude about it, and even tipped her $10.00 the first time, that I now feel wasn't deserved. People make mistakes, but to be rude too customers that give you a 2nd chance and rush them to begin with is intolerable and disrespectful. I work in customer service and will not return too this location and now have to find someone else I have too pay to fix it a 2nd time.",,"{'time': 1575259558610, 'text': 'We appreciate you being our customer, Brian!

Food was decent. Albeit it was a tad salty for me, I could still feel the freshness of the meat and other ingredients used.
I ordered a Philly chicken and felt it was a wee bit expensive for the size of the sandwich.
Next time will try something else before making a judgement.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCBPnLUtNBIc8tTw_GP8QxvBZAZmgdTstjseKA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOLq5eS1EDduGC1Q5S8ezkgLIfaLhe2-pAPhIz7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",,0x887f86a182eedf69:0xca134f04d86721a4,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was a little  skeptical when we first pulled up to the restaurant.  Do NOT let the exterior of the building deter you! The food is exceptional!

The service was good and the environment clean, cozy and friendly. My new go to for Mediterranean for sure!

Jim's table side Cesar salad and steak flambeing combined with Steph's table side service were a true treat. Did find the Horseradish, blue cheese, cream cheese dip interesting...

It's also okay if you're looking for pre-packaged ramen that's been doctored up with a few ingredients. But please go in expecting an Americanized version of JP food and nothing authentic. I left full and with leftovers, but very underwhelmed.

(Their take on fried tofu is also uniquely similar to buying into a pumice stone, so word of warning there.)

The bao are fabulous, though. And the edamame looked great, even though I didn't have any.

Their game and game console selection is very large, and they even have certain PC games and trading cards, Skylanders, amiibos, etc. Usually if they don't have what you're looking for, you can give them a name and phone number to call and they will contact you when it will soon be available.",,,0x89c6b930900c508b:0xf87086b581c866fb,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I ordered a beef and sausage combo, very well made.
I also ordered a 4 ingredient pizza with sausage, onion, bacon, and green pepper. The there was way too much onions to the point where the crust was soggy, but burned on the ends and it turns out I didn't even get any bacon. The onions weren't cut into little squares, but long strips. I've ordered 4 ingredient pizzas before and it was never this bad.

Also, the online ordering website interface was changed for the worse. I loved it when it first came out, but whoever updated it doesn't know how to touch up convenience. This isn't Sycamore's fault but Rosati's themselves.",,,0x880f29574b40ee5d:0x6863ad50fa240fdc,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The menu says that the chicken parmigiana comes with a salad and garlic bread. When i ordered the guy said oh sorry we dont do that anymore. Ok w/e. So it gets to me in about 30 min. I told the guy my apartment number and he had to call me to get it again which is no problem but he was rude and impatient sounding like it was somehow my fault...was also rude giving me my food but still tossed him a decent tip lol. So to the food. My breaded mushrooms are soggy and have very little flavor cant even eat them. The chicken parmigiana looked really good when i opened it, but the sauce is watery and hardly any flavor as well. The 2 liter of coke was on point and delicious. Will never be ordering from here again and you should rethink it also. There are plenty of good italian joints in sycamore to waste money here.

Seriously?

110351688460664568849,Jas Sawhney,1560206274017.0,5.0,"This venue is one of those places that must be visited and seen to believe how exceptional it is.  This is a members only club that has gives you 5 star service with attention to detail in every aspect.

The moment you walk in, you are greeted with a smile and the experience starts.   Members get to have a private locker where you can store your own cigars and alcohol.   Yes, this is a BYO place, so all you have to pay for is the food and cigars if don't bring your own.  Speaking of food they have an amazing chef just for Sushi and a really nice food menu comparable to any high end steakhouse.

As a member I was able to bring 3 friends with me to come and enjoy an evening.  We started with Sushi/Sashimi which was exceptionally good.   Afterwards we ordered lamb chops, which were some of the best I've ever had.   For dinner we decided to share a Tomahawk and a chicken.  As expected, the Tomahawk was huge, Flinstones style!  Fred would have been proud, lol.  The chicken was very different, flavorful and juicy.  After dinner we went to the other room for smoking cigars.

They have two rooms.  One where you can eat, and another where you can eat and smoke.  I guess this is done so if someone was not interested in smoking, you have access to a smoke-free room.  The smoking room is beautifully decorated and has the best ambiance of any cigar club I have been to.

They have a good selection of cigars you can chose from and they are kept in a great humidity condition to keep them fresh.  The night we went, there was also a live Jazz singer, which definitely added to the ambiance.

In closing I'll just say, that this place doesn't feel like it's in NJ.  Once you enter and start to enjoy, you feel like you are sitting in a 5 star luxury venue  in Dubai or Hong Kong.   There is nothing that comes close to Royale on the East Coast!","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmaCPFchnmGw5N81XjaiK1Xt999BsohXzIM8iS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmlZ-NzpG1RdmMaFivU07A9rsJbCzI6IqCohKz=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeC_d1FNsxHIWb8r-FP7MSxHpBmKQ2_VtpGzg_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUqLXOZu0Coj3saFfB-lf0YKa456EUtG8EAENC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_PBHoTZOobPgC7cRMnR1dvZfwmP697KwmzhFZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNn17ULU0onc0KBqpIZFYzDTrAjYRWPSrfT90bm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]","{'time': 1565701664309, 'text': ""Hey Jas!

They are a lot cheaper than the two other major pharmacy stores located in the area, I always tend to visit here when I want a cheap bite to eat or a snack since every week they always have a changing offer to give you which is a delightful treat. I wish the frozen food and ice cream shelves had more to offer because sometimes I noticed it was empty. Nonetheless, would come here if you wanted to buy something affordable but don't have the time to go elsewhere.",,,0x89c2feb7e793e253:0xe12f9cf2805478ca,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I always purchase the interior cleaning option and my windows always need cleaning when I get home. Part of the problem is the attendant ""over sprays"" the glass and ultimately ends up with a wet cloth. My windows look worse than they did before he ""cleaned"" them. Another problem is the attendant uses the same cloth to dry the car as he does on the windows.

Cleaning a car is an art as much as it is a process.  In my opinion, there are only a few people working here that care about the quality of work, and the owner/manager is one of them. I notice the worker turnover rate is fairly high, it's too bad his staff isn't more dedicated.",,"{'time': 1570627408132, 'text': 'Hi Brian.  My name is Joe, I’m the owner of Willowbrook Car Wash.

Once you've ordered the smorgasbord, I have to recommend the duck confit. The duck meat is a beautiful beet red color and melts in your mouth. The skin is perfectly crispy. And then for dessert, you can't go wrong with proliferats. Eclair like pastries hold a delicious vanilla ice cream with a hot chocolate sauce poured over. It's perfection.

On Monday evening they offer a prix fix meal (I didn't get it, but a few in my party did, and it was a great deal). I was a little disappointed that the only salad option on the regular menu wound up being $7 for literally just butter lettuce covered in grated parmesan cheese and a vinaigrette. Maybe it felt disappointing because the prix fix salad looked much nicer (even if it was a tad smaller, there was more to it than lettuce, cheese, and dressing), though I can't complain about the taste. I had the steak tartare for my entree and it was satisfyingly delicious. Then my friends who had the prix fix meal had their dessert delivered to them yet the waiter hadn't asked anyone else in the party if we wanted dessert, and the prix fix dessert hadn't been described. I'm glad I hadn't gotten the prix fix meal as the dessert had shaved coconut,  and I'm not a big fan of that though a taste was very good, but I did have the chocolate mousse dessert, and that was divine. I could have eaten an entire bowl. Overall I'd give this place 4.5 stars, and if I lived closer, I would go back again some time.",[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObWVC4qmSuULWOjhD-jk2NH4zyQdQnq68qY7xP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}],,0x89b1117bf4e4343b:0xd70a9cbbd1ca0391,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Covid protocols made me feel comfortable while enjoying some perfectly crispy-soft fries with aoili, two varieties of balanced & fresh glasses of white wine, and the most options I've ever seen available for a charcuterie board. We selected three meats and cheeses, in addition to the pickled veggies and perfectly textured bread that comes with it. We ended the meal with a fresh peach galette- crispy pastry, tarragon (!) on the peaches, and vanilla bean ice cream. I don't regret a single sip or bite of this amazing meal!

A lot of ingredients seemed to be locally sourced as well. Prices were really reasonable for the quality of food.  The restaurant isn't huge and they don't have many large tables, so call ahead, go early or go prepared to enjoy a drink at the bar if you do have to wait.

100974818554762906958,R N,1507748906893.0,5.0,"It is VERY embarrassing walking into a dentist with a broken tooth or cavity. I was mortified when my tooth broke, and tried to hide it when I smiled or talked. So of course opening my mouth and showing it to dental professionals wouldn't be ideal. I always panic that dentists will judge me. I never got to go to dentists as a child, so admittedly I haven't had much experience in the clinics, and have a couple bad teeth.

The staff did nothing but make me feel comfortable about my oral issues. Dr. Jared, the dentist I was lucky enough to work with, engaged in conversation with me, and made sure that I knew all the facts before going into dental surgery. He made sure I was okay SEVERAL times, and made sure I was numb enough throughout my six hours there. (I am crazy and elected to do two surgeries at once.)
He offered a ton of professional advise, and his assistants were equally sweet and helpful. I was so comfortable, that during my root canal I fell asleep TWICE.
My impression of this location is SO high, that I don't see myself going to any other dentist's office. They know what they are doing. They care about you as a person, and want you to feel better. My tooth was at the brink of not being savable, but Dr. Jared was able to get a crown placed in!

108415843395403265943,Ala Crity,1387142005323.0,5.0,"I got a cavity-ridden wisdom tooth removed. They took my blood pressure which is a great sign that not all dentists do, but should!! They are not lazy here. I had previously gone to another dentist not affiliated with Comfort Dental to have my tooth removed, but they had given me numbing shots and nothing else. Their work was one of the most painful experiences of my life, I flew off the table, was screaming the entire time and started bawling after they tried chipping my tooth in half. I've never had a bad experience at the dentist prior to that even though I always had a lot of cavities growing up. That experience made me VERY scared, anxious, and apprehensive about going to another dentist, like I literally have anxiety. Keep in mind, I also had a horrible cavity in that tooth all the way down to the gums and the tooth came in sideways. I also have inflamed gums i.e. gingivitis and haven't been to a dentist in like five years. So I called around to dentists comparing prices. Most dentists charge around $400-900 per tooth, if not more, which is absolutely outrageous!! I simply cannot afford it! My friend heard about Comfort and referred me to them. I was apprehensive at first, because I figured if you go the cheapest route it might be crappy work or really painful like the last place.....Well, Comfort was none of that, and was simply amazing!! I had laughing gas, and numbing shots. The only real things I felt at first which was the shots, which wasn't bad. Later, it felt like my jaw was going to break with how wide it was while they were working on my tooth and it was quite sore during the procedure, but in all honesty, it wasn't that bad and I was giggling half the time. After the appointment I said I wanted to do it again because the laughing gas was fun, lol. My first experience with it. I'm still recovering and my jaw is still sore, but that's to be expected and I'm satisfied they did a good job. Well, I have three more wisdom teeth to be done, and I'm happy to have found a good dentist to go back to time and time again and I trust them with my life.

However they often run out of Slurpees and the fountain drink syrup mix is not calculated correctly, tasting too much like fizz. Their evening staff are not customer friendly.  This is complicated by the fact that I've been shorted several times in change, and they charge more for their pop refills than other local stores.

I recommend trying the 7-11s at 13 & Campbell or 9 mile and Hilton.  Their staff is much more congenial and it will save you a buck or two.",,,0x8824cf7e49232ccf:0x88d1c1429018c70f,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My  return was not a result of a misdiagnosis by any means...it was due to me needing another dose of steroid to help alleviate the itching rash. In fact, Dr. Asghar had suggested that if my symptoms did not improve, to return for re-evaluation. He  and nurse Dawn Green were again very pleasant, informative and thorough. Dr. Asghar is very sincere and takes time to listen and explain. It is a very warm and welcoming atmosphere, wonderful for when you are not feeling your best.

They provide some in house medications and are quick to submit prescriptions to your pharmacy. This enables them to be ready for pick up on the way home ( if fillable per stock at your chosen pharmacy). It is so convenient and swift.

I felt as though I was being held hostage until I signed paperwork. They took my keys to ""value"" my car and wouldn't return them even after asking for them multiple times. They wouldn't let me leave to get lunch, finally did, but had to come with. We arrived at noon and didn't leave until 11 pm! I didn't get any paperwork, didn't get to see any numbers on what I signed, just had to sign to get out. By the way, we were buying 2 cars! I almost passed out in the parking lot while leaving as we didn't get dinner. The worst part is I requested multiple times to come back the following day as we had to bring back a trade in anyway and my son was home alone, and they kept pushing to get it done right away. I'm half tempted to return the one car when I take in the other trade today.

Update: Turning in the trade today was much less frustrating than yesterday, everything went smoothly, paperwork was in order, and staff was very helpful and friendly. Despite some of the hassles, I would still recommend, and even revisit the dealership.

Great listed prices.  Arrived at 8 am.  The first 8 hours was spent just trying to find a car that hadn't been sold (we found out that many of the cars on their website were long gone).  The first 9 cars ""the keys aren't available"" (code for I don't know where it is, or it's probably sold so let's look for something else).  Then we found one that we liked AND was still there.  And then discovered why... it won't start.  Can't jump it... just dead.  So no wonder why it was still there -- nobody could move it!  During the 11th hour (literally 11 hours after we had arrived) magic struck and we found a car that WOULD start and hadn't been sold.  Great price.  Salesman said the price of the car was $32,790.  Got back into the finance office only to discover they want to also charge $599 for ""window tint and nitrogen"".  Wait a sec, isn't that part of the car?  Shouldn't that have been disclosed when telling us the price of the car?  I can't make this up.  I tell them there is no way I'm paying for something twice and to take the $599 off.  I'm paying cash for this car.  The manager refused to take it off, so we walked... over a $599 ""window tint and nitrogen"" charge.  I've never seen these sort of crooked sales tactics at any dealership I've ever been to.

Having worked with other car dealerships who are honest and transparent I thought they all were.  Honda of Ft.Myers is not.  They refused to let me get a loan with my bank. Insisted i had to use theirs.  Then they padded my loan with 6,000 worth of items i didnt ask for or was told about.  Non of the paperwork given to me had a line item listing the extra charges.  I returned and asked for it.  I got a lot of double talk and bluff of canceling the sale.  When they finally took 4,500 off.  I bought a used  car and they refused to take 599.00 for window tinting.  He tried to tell me they provide that service to all their cars.  Except it was done when the car was originally bought.  So..they tinted it twice??  Along with the car sealant that was never done?

I ordered the mini pizza with pepperoni, bacon, and sausage and an antipasto salad with no anchovies (ew!) and raspberry vinaigrette. Given that tonight is a rainy, icky night I figured my food would be delivered on the end of the expected time, but it actually arrived 5 minutes early! The mini pizza was still relatively hot (I live almost 15 minutes away, so I was happy) and tasted great! I didn't realize it was thin crust, but the restaurant managed to keep the crust from being brittle, which is usually my complaint with thin crust pizza. There was tons of each topping and overall, I was an excited customer. For the salad, in addition to the meat, there were kalamata olives, cucumbers, a hard boiled egg, tomatoes, tons of red onion, and carrots. I took out the olives, cucumbers, egg, tomatoes, and most of the onion, but that still left A LOT of meat! I've never seen an antipasto salad with this much. Furthermore, the amount of dressing provided is fantastic. Overall, I was exceedingly pleased with my order and plan on returning.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONGABu6hMS7QEiNDLOTWcv5na9ICNIyVonjzO1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMP3G6TBPv_ddFdH5fLIt7qnpS8tNupYuJFLhoC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]","{'time': 1536536827381, 'text': 'Thank you for posting, Asheley.

They all have attitudes and for a place to have to deal with customers directly every day they are open, they sure do know how to not listen to what we have to say. Instead they give you excuses of how long they've been doing this job and how your wrong. Even though the website clearly states what you need in order to show proof of either insurance, or residency, or even in the military. Be prepared to get treated with attitude and lack of knowledge. Also be prepared to make two trips to satisfy their mood. Power hungry is the way they are instead of being helpful.",,,0x888ccda33ed4b46d:0xd570aaba7f910ff6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pizza was good.

However the wings were way too crispy. So we asked them to send a new order. The did not have enough to give us 24 as we had order but agreed to send 12 and credit her for 12.

The next batch showed up and they too we're no eatable.

So we sent them back requesting another credit.

The owner proceeded to call my mother and yell at her, saying how we just cost him 45 bucks. He offered her the mkmon back and requested that we not do business there anymore.

I don't believe in the customer is always right but with having eaten their wings many times she knew what they were supposed to be like.

For him to call her and yell at her was completely out of line.

Not to mention, I got deep deep stares because of how nicely dressed I was. Looked like they were gonna mug me. The staff was rude, and they have CRAZY polices. For example, You can't have visitors, you have to PAY extra to use the NASTY pool. And you only have 5 minutes to rush to your room and look for bugs to get a refund. Or else it's final. And you have to pay. Also, the front desk guy will try and keep your ID if you don't demand it back. The rooms were nasty. There was a roach in the pillow case. It smells like sex, weed, and body odor. There was hair in the sink. And the trash was full. Unless you're just trying to make a quick drug deal or muder somebody.

First, we attempted to call the Shadeland Inn twice prior to booking but the phone just continued to ring with no answer. We then booked online. We tried calling twice more the day of our stay but those calls also went unanswered. Not good if you want to CANCEL! The outside appearance is quite concerning, but once inside it isn't that bad. During out stay we had a number of problems. The headboard was loose, so much so it was balanced on the end tables on either sides of the bed. The toilet would run about every 15 minutes, but only for a couple seconds. And lastly, while having a microwave in the room was a plus, the sparks which flew from the outlet which it was plugged into was a huge negative! The area isn't the best, and around midnight we were woken up by a commotion right outside our room's window. Apparently the hotel kicked out a group, and they just those types of people. But a hotel can't control its clientele. However, as stated the area isn't ideal. The front desk worker was very kind when these issues were presented at checkout.

My problem is that I have caught them two different times adding things that we didn't orord at the register. Your never handed a guest check. The waitress puts the order in and gives the check to the register. You go to the register to pay and they just start adding things up without letting you see the guest check. I add things up as I decide what I qm going to ordet. The 1st time was off by $12 and $10 the second. So, I asked to see my guest check and each time they were reluctant to do so. They argued with my wife about it and I had to step in. The second time different waitress same register host made excuses.  So, keep track of what you order and whatch them.

I even got a VM wishing me a Happy B-day. There's also a Dry Cleaner, Dollar General, Total Fitness, Dentist office, Diabetes Center, a Nail salon, and a Tobacco/Cigar shop & lounge.
