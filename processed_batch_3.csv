Everytime we have bern through drive-thru for the last 3 months has been incorrect. We have called to report it nearly every time but nothing gets done. Today topped it. We ordered a Junior Bacon Burrito. We pulled out, got down the road & checked & it was wrong...again. I tried to call them 8 times. When they finally chose to answer (and they were not busy) they picked up, hung up then took the phone off the hook. Once I reached them an hour later I told the man what happened & his comment was, "" Alright, alright, thank you."" Then he promptly hung up on me while I was still speaking.

Get there and hostess seats us at tablets around bar with a 11 month old. Says everything else is closed for the night, so we have to sit by bar...Ok... we make due... Waitress at our table every three mins asking if we KNOW WHAT WE WANT.... I finally order us appetizers which there are only 3 that are half price after whatever time they have.  Wings, Mozzarella sticks and Spinach dip.  Why even advertise it when you have full page of apps and the deal only works with 3 basic choices. BS...
We have questions about one of new dishes and she says it's so good, so me and wife get it....
Comes out, looks good but parmesan sauce tastes like it came out of a can that was on shelf way to long...
Half way thru we notice that other couples with babies around same age as ours have been seated where hostess told us 20 minutes ago that was closed for the night... Like one review before mine I read.... This place has failed to impress me the last couple of times we've been here....

112005243120458265369,Federico Arce,1621531205162.0,2.0,"First the good things about the place: the vibe and the design is really nice, the table service as well was good. The hotel seems newly renovated with a very authentic look.

Now the areas of improvement: the friendliness of the staff at the entrance when you are waiting to be seated has to be better. Not a single smile or a sign that says we would love for you to give us a try. The second and I think the most important one is that the food was not good at all. A disappointment given the reviews the place has. Veggie scrambled eggs and a Steak Benedict is what we ordered, but unfortunately that could have been done a lot better. Sort of greasy and charred from the griddle is the look that they had. Maybe there a better options on the menu, saw a great croissant breakfast and waffles on a different table. So I guess the point is that if you want a plate that is more on the delicate side, that has a great English muffin toasted just right, with an amazing Hollandaise sauce, maybe it‚Äôs better to look for a different place. I should have ordered the breakfast tacos! üòÖ

Anyway the place looks nice enough to give it a second chance at lunch maybe, keeping in mind to stay with the simpler more popular dishes.",,,0x88d9b49b64fc55c9:0x6f8f249fb28f0fd5,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It came with tomatoes, which I liked, but it also came w caramelized onions, which I thought was a bit weird and mismatched. I did like the fact that they didn‚Äôt drench the bread with butter, like a lot of other places tend to do. I think if they did away with the onions, and made the cheese meltier, then it would have been perfect. The fries were amazing though so I guess that kind of made up for it.

Dr. Moses performed an US for far less than other ""experts"" have charged for other cats and came up with diagnosis for his almost daily vomiting.  Inflammation of his upper GI tract, duodenum and stomach and thickened lymph nodes.  Initially he was started on an ointment to his ear pinna daily to stimulate appetite and boy did it.  I was thrilled he was finally eating again. Then I started him on Prednisolone chicken liquid which mixes well in his wet food and he eats it.  The 1 cc daily turned out to be too much since that caused diarrhea but I have backed him down to 1/3 of a cc and still no vomiting and no diarrhea and he is eating like a normal healthy cat.  Thank you Dr. Moses for quick diagnosis and meds to assist him.  Cat ONLY vet is the way to go.  I had learned that lesson in Nashville, but then strayed after several moves.

If there is an issue with a patron, you contact them directly, NOT in front of their guests. This is NOT my first review, and I attempted to make it vaugue, the last time.
To approach a patron, with a defense of the food in question, ""It is our best seller and sales have gone up"", unbelieveable.
Correct way to handle this?
""I am so sorry that you weren't satisfied with the new menu. Hopefully, there is something on the menu that you would prefer. It has been a great seller, but I understand that some simply don't like it and would prefer the old style. If there is anything I can do to make this better for you, please let me know. I would like to recommend, X-Y-Z on the menu, it is new and we have had several compliments. Again, I apologize that the menu has changed and I will definitley push this forward to our corporate office. Maybe it will come back."" This is EXACTLY what I would have said to save a long time patron.
Not defend the damn menu, and damn sure not approach a patron who spends well over $100 each visit and tips unbelievably well, in front of his guests.
We WILL NOT return to Tom's, that is a promise.
This was a business meeting and unfortunately, Tim was an example to my employee of ""What not to do"" when there is a disgruntled client.",,,0x89e673ac83cf225b:0x7ee4de4dfea4cbc9,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was a full of boxes, staff coats and purses and the trash barrels.

The restaurant was almost full and yet there had to be eight or ten tables there that couldn't be used.

We went here when the place first opened and found it to be very good and clean but we probably won't go back.

105577245413238239186,William DeArmon (Bill),1483392073561.0,3.0,"Our family has been coming here for a few years, and the first couple visits were pretty good; service was fast and friendly and food was better than average, but the last couple visits have shown a marked decrease in service and food quality.

This is a sit down restaurant along the lines of a Waffle House or Dennys, but with a quaint local vibe to it, or at least it used to. The name Trips comes from the triplet children of the owner, though I'm not sure which are the triplets; it used to be mostly staffed by family, and service was always friendly and fast.

When our family visits here we usually come in for breakfast, and today was no exception. I ordered my usual 2 eggs over medium, ham, grits and toast. Placed my order and waited. Waitress was friendly enough but kinda grumpy, but not to the point of making me angry, but enough to tell her ""please just make my order to go"" which made her give me a strange look. Anyway, she wasn't ""unfriendly "" I just felt like I wasn't welcomed there. I had a decaf coffee while I waited, which was very good and fresh.

Got my food, ordered a slice of cheesecake and cup of milk to go with it and left. Got home, opened box of food and everything was intact but apparently they only give you one piece of toast now, even though the prices have slightly risen over time.

Food was average, nothing special, toast was burned and ham was cooked too dry, grits were pasty but at least they weren't runny...their grits taste almost like cream of wheat which I don't like, but they're ok.

I'll probably return due to proximity, but the place has lost some of its charm, though it's still popular with the locals. They do have a couple of outdoor tables and the place stays pretty packed all day. I think they're only open breakfast and lunch, but they're open 7 days.

I'll still recommend it as an average breakfast joint, but that's it.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqYftOmfVSvEPLrBH8_a2h3DvDL_TTS_opPTy-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNw8JuEgDWhPXUze_o6oNdnH4lPKi2tnUK74E2W=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNl43n36LnLAfYq2Y4jKltQbC5Y-F0dY1bsqVqg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqjO6SUEpyu0hNLL6_dHy1I2TOga7SRPUDHV5q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",,0x88c2e1f6768d0411:0xaad6048fa480edad,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He asked very rudely if we wanted a drink and when he brought the two glasses of water he slammed them on the table. I was sure to be very polite and say thank you. I didn‚Äôt give this guy ANY reason to be rude to me and my friend but he never loosened up and became friendly. I work in a restaurant. When someone comes in and you want to close, yeah it sucks, but you are representing a business and the sign says open so you smile and act polite. The guy did not act like he wanted our business, so he‚Äôs never getting it again, plain and simple.",,,0x8893e3f057b4a989:0x66a6eff7942bb114,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also they require a credit card authorization even if u pay cash when you get there...the hours continually change. 2 weeks ago they were open til 10:30 on Sat but tonight its 10.   They're rude about the delivery hours and the card as well. If not for the fact the hibachi is pretty decent for take out (I'm still not convinced they even deliver) I couldn't even bother writing this review but I'm hoping maybe it might improve.

Is also handicap accessible that includes wheelchair accessible. They have vending machines they're a little expensive but you would expect a highway rest stop. Do the seats to sit on the inside and quite nice and warm in the winter and air-conditioned in the summertime. There's also a map system that shows you the state of Iowa to include weather conditions Highway Patrol headquarters locations and more information about the state. For you pet owners there's a place for you to take your pet  so they can go potty. I also think there's closed circuit cameras at all the rest stops for Public Safety is this rest areas open 24/7.

Usually I dine at Voodoo Crab, but since it's out of the way I decided to give Crab Du Jour a try. Let me say, it's just as comparable if not better than the other spot. The sauce is thick and buttery, seasoned well with lots of garlic. I'm allergic to almost all seafood including shrimp. I'm very limited in the choices of seafood that I can enjoy so I was able to pick things I can eat which included calamari, lobster, and crab. The corn was sweet and cooked perfectly as were the potatos. The calamari and crab legs were cooked well, but I think the lobster tail might have been just slightly overdone as it was hard to get out the shell. Overall, the food was great and I'm glad this spot is in the neighborhood. I would love to dine in sometime soon to feel the hospitality of the staff.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMufDtdnRhMZg9h0FktWLxuBs7OtwGDMI4FEocK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN51sseEXspqCRrJu7AIe_twJLfKHK9bFaMYI-K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]","{'time': 1605835829222, 'text': ""Hi Cassandra, thank you for giving us a try.

The food was great everyone in my party had King Crab which wasn't over cooked.

The crab meat fries as well as the fried pickles were fresh. The drinks were not watered down, but still maintained great flavor without over bearing alcohol taste. Reasonably priced menu.

Nothing really negative to say at all.

A member of my party did mention his oysters were overcooked..but he ate them fast..so take that how you want.

Update:

My friends and I returned again on 12/12/20 before the city closed in door dining again.
The king crab was so great the last time, we decided to return.
Food was great, drinks were great. Fruit punch and lemonade for the designated driver tasted cheap.

This time the waitress was a little too talkative even adding ""You know king crab is 35.99 a pound, right?""..then when our party was discussing her tip..she chimed in ""gruitity isn't included on the bill"" *no one asked her*

She talked herself out of an extra $20, but she was nice otherwise.  I'm sure she wasn't intentionally being rude.",,"{'time': 1606774508121, 'text': ""Hey Jamal.

Heading to the gates, love the smaller airport experience. More cool stuff at Bradley

Update: The Black Bear Saloon has a problem getting the kitchen open by 9am

I've had it happen 3 times this year. It's now 9:25 and no idea when kitchen will open.

We travelers depend on airport businesses to be on time and do what they say.

It's obvious that the Black Bear kitchen opening at 9 is just a possibility

Hopefully airport staff can help improve this problem

Once inside the airport feels quite roomy, not claustrophobic, and is very clean and well run.  There is a small food court with ample options for formal and casual dining as well as some retail just beyond security.  There are many nooks and crannies with plush chairs that allow you to get work done while watching the aircraft.  The airport, despite its low traffic numbers, offers nonstop domestic service to most major cities of the contiguous USA and nonstop service to Europe.  It is nice to be able to fly nonstop to Europe without having to go to one of the horrible New York City area airports.",,,0x89e6fdc26190ccb9:0x275b7ad4b5f1a765,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our waitress Erica was helpful and dropped by often but not to the point of annoyance to see if we were ok. The ambiance is old, rustic, country  with brick and wood decor. I ordered the steak and it was tender and amazing. The kids raved the pizza so it must be good. These kids have been spoiled with living in Italy for years so I take their response with conviction. The soup I ordered was a sweet butternut squash and it was great. The salad had rich dark and green leaves that are definitely fresh greens and not iceburg. The vinegerate was a perfect complement to the salad. I also had the apple cake with a good cup of coffee and vanilla ice cream. It's a nice cozy spot.I probably can't say it the best around this area because I have not tried anything around but I will be coming back here  if I'm back to this area.

Initially, I was apprehensive about the procedure that I was having (root canal) but from the time I stepped into the facility, until the time I left I was almost never happier to be at the Dentist's office. (LOL). Dr. Hosseini is THE BEST! He was so patient, so understanding and SO calm - he has such a peaceful soul, that I fell asleep during the procedure and had NO PAIN afterwards! His staff followed up the next day, to make sure that I was ok, and I really appreciate that -my HCP or regular Dentist doesn't even do that!

The office is modernly decorated; very light and esthetically pleasing to the senses and the staff is ultra-friendly and engaging. I've worked in healthcare for almost 30 years, so I can completely appreciate a client's anxiety when coming to see the provider, but I experienced NONE of that. I told one of the front office clerks that this facility is a blueprint for great customer service; they did everything right.

BLUF, if you must have ANY extensive dental work done, SEE Dr. Hosseini and his staff, ASAP! I highly recommend it.

Great Job!!!!!!!",,,0x89ab6b4a02b3c04f:0x475f9b4ce076f7d0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a local dental professional our practice refers our patients to Sandhills Endodontics because they are experts in their field. Today I had the privilege of experiencing this first hand. Pam  answered my call prior to their office even opening and was able to  accommodate a same day appointment because I was in so much pain. The Assistants were so kind and reassuring. Dr. Hosseini was incredibly gently! I even dozed off during my root canal. He  explained every step of the procedure as it was happening to ensure I was comfortable and there were no surprises.  This office truly cares about their patience and I am so  grateful to Dr. Hosseini and his amazing team for providing such quality care.,,,0x89ab6b4a02b3c04f:0x475f9b4ce076f7d0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
100387921968425566298,Roro Carroll,1563922281130.0,5.0,I have been to Sandhill Endodontics twice for two different route canals (ashamed to admit that) within 3 years and both times have exceeded my expectations. Dr. Hosseini and his team are OUTSTANDING!  I received the same great customer service last week that I did 3 years ago. I was actually happy that my dentist referred me back to this office just because I remembered it being a pleasant experience. There was NO PAIN from the numbing medicine to the actual procedure. Dr. H makes sure that you are comfortable and takes his time explaining what he's doing. He's such nice guy and you can't help but feel like he truly cares about you and loves what he does. You get his phone number to call for a emergency and the office followed up with me the next business day to check and see how I was recovering. This business is the real deal!  Not to mention the office is beautiful. Thank you Dr. Hosseini and team. I hope I don't have to get another route canal but if I do Sandhill Endodontics will be my go to.,,,0x89ab6b4a02b3c04f:0x475f9b4ce076f7d0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon arrival, my husband and I were stunned by how beautiful the office looked on the outside and inside. The receptionist was very professional and friendly and the waiting area (which already had a very large flatscreen) also offered bottled beverages and complimentary coffee. I am an extremely nervous and terrified patient from past dental nightmares so the friendliness was much needed to say the least.
Much to my surprise though, the Endodontics's Doctor I was scheduled with, Dr. Daniel Bondra, D.D.S, was absolutely wonderful and extremely informative. He thoroughly explained each and every beep, scratch, press and/or grinding noises prior to doing them and, more importantly, Dr. Bondra ensured that I was comfortable and pain free entirely the whole way through.
I would 100% recommend this office to anyone who has to have endodontic work performed. I had zero anxiety once the work began and I seriously felt NO discomfort. Great job!!!",,,0x89ab6b4a02b3c04f:0x475f9b4ce076f7d0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My husband and I decided to check it out since we do try to support local spots in town, ESPECIALLY those spots on the north and east side of town since they tend to be so easily missed out on by people who won't look north of russell pkwy. We got a really decent (actually great) amount of food (lobster tail, shrimp, corn, crab legs, potatoes and eggs) for under 50 bucks. The concept is super easy and really convient too. The food is made and you can either have it warmed there to eat or they can butter and season it for you to take home and warm. We had all of our food out into a metal baking pan with butter and season and all we had to do when we got home was pop it in the oven for a few and it's honestly better than any food at any local chains I've eaten, and frankly it is the best I've had in the area. Easily as great as something you'd get by the ocean but really cheaper and easier than having to go to a restaurant packed with people. The 2 men inside working were super helpful and nice and when he said we were in for a treat he was 100% correct on that. I highly recommend this place and the only thing I would have changed was knowing about it Sooner.

I have been the world over and had all kinds of the therapeutic massages, Swedish, deep tissue, sports, Thai, shiatsu, trigger point etc. Sunny is a world class therapist with combination of  intuitiveness and genuine kindness. She is completely in tune with you the whole way through. She is communicative, informative and interested in truly helping you relax or in my case heal. She used a combination of modalities and really paid attention to my breathing and responses and adapted and/or adjusted accordingly. In a a city filled with imposters posing as therapists Sunny is the real deal if you want a truly fantastic professional, therapeutic massage. She could be working at any of the highest end hotel spas in the world but we are fortunate to have her here. The price is VERY reasonable for the level of therapist that she is.

One of the approaches that sets Horizon apart from other funeral homes is the upfront way in which we disclose our pricing. Even so, funeral service pricing can get a little convoluted, and under the best of circumstances it's a stressful process for families to navigate. Circumstances are sometimes a little bit different. Funeral establishments typically have pricing stratified by body weight. If they don't, then they are typically charging upwards of a couple thousand dollars to begin with. We strive to be upfront and clear about what we charge, and feel completely comfortable with the value we provide and the clarity with which we communicate the entire arrangement process, including pricing.We will make a greater effort to avoid confusion moving forward.""}",0x872bafe174acae63:0x80556257131d9e0c,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was told to go to Horizon Funeral Care by someone familiar with them. From the moment I walked in I was shown true compassion. Deak helped me pick out what I needed. I just picked up the urn today and one again everyone involved at Horizon showed a sincere caring attitude towards me. They even wrote, 'Aunt Karen's Remains'. They go that extra step. I'm blessed to have had them help me during this time. I promise you, you will be glad you chose them.",,,0x872bafe174acae63:0x80556257131d9e0c,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They never once said anything about our time being up. Theyhad an adorable little lab puppy there that day which helped our grieving process too.

I had some fairly serious dental problems that he helped me with, and was always the most gentle and thorough dentist I've ever seen!  I traveled from center city Philadelphia to see Dr. Q for 3 of the 5 years I've been a patient - he is worth it.  For 2 years my insurance was not accepted there, and his staff worked with me on a fair out-of-pocket price, and the cost of my crown was incredibly reasonable.  The office is ALWAYS clean, the staff is ALWAYS friendly, they offer flexible hours, and I actually look forward to going to my appointments.  They also provide services for patients with dentures.  There is not much else to say.  He and his staff are the best.

Paul spent over an hour with me driving and inspecting every inch of the Shelby both mechanical parts as well as the body.  What I liked was that with the few issues he found he suggested having the dealer work with me instead of suggesting he do the work himself.  Paul was honest and up front.  No pressure.

This is actually inside the gas station, not a food truck. I got the mother trucker burger with fries and a drink. The burger was quite good, certainly better than any fast food place. It had a nice texture and some good flavor. The bun was very fresh. The fries were good, nothing to get worked up about. The lemonade was pretty flavorless. The guy running the grill was very pleasant and personable. On a scale of 0-10  I would rate this 6.4","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7l66NxH83NdyEVIKwsquW4IxsdnaackjeXOT6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdgMUye1ov2BpHq3G9U0WIU3cuVIv8liiC2Gvk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP43n9gI7stN2L7v9YK1MsvElWFrEEweDH-ff8X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",,0x89e5d5f0d9622763:0x84fdcfc0d4cefef7,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This third lease is the last straw. The office staff has changed and they are never available. My door keeps getting propped open and nothing is done to ensure the safety of the people living within the building.

Under new ownership since about a year(?) ago. They're doing some nice renovations etc which keep the place clean and looking good.
I've never had a problem or issue with the staff here. They're respectful and address issues as early as possible.

Apartments:
The laundry system is pretty nice and the machine wash/dry well.
The unit I'm in has few and spread out outlets making it difficult to get power in a few spots.
New blinds don't keep light out at night that comes in from parking lot lamps (not huge, just had to add paper blinds underneath).
I like the fake wood laminate, easy  to clean and looks good for what it is.
Lots of space open design which I really appreciate.

The one gripe I have is that it's a bit annoying to get packages, sometimes. Because of the location we get vagrants trying to seek shelter in the breezeways so the doors are constantly locked during the day. Due to this sometimes packages go to the office and they leave @ 5pm, which is totally acceptable but it just makes it difficult to get my packages sometimes. In spite of this if it's an especially important package management is willing to drop packages off inside your apartment door.

I'm paying 925 + 125ish in utilities/fees per month and that seems fair for the market right now for a 1br1ba 700sqft place. I'd hope it doesn't go up too much next lease cycle just because they can due to the market. I'd like to stay, but if the price goes up crazy like it did at my last decent cozy place, I'd be willing to leave and find something more reasonable.",,,0x876b873ac7c4f55f:0xdaeaf8d5fbe49a4e,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cobwebs were in all the closets. The corners of each room had cobwebs at ceiling height. Cobwebs, dust and grime covered the tops of the kitchen cabinets, toilets were not thoroughly cleaned, as we found used Qtips stuck to it's base and behind the seat. There were cobwebs everywhere in the Laundry Room, the light fixtures were left with insects in the globes, cobwebs/ dirt on all the light fixtures. The downstairs linoleum was not swept or mopped. The carpet in the 2nd bedroom was not vacuumed. The window sills were not wiped out. All these things were quoted in the estimate and not done correctly. Lastly, the vehicle that the team arrived in leaked oils all over our driveway!!!! The team members, to their credit, were exceptionally nice as they left. When we got the invoice, we literally gasped!! We were quoted one price, then we saw that number doubled plus $10.00.  I called and spoke to them hoping to amicably resolve the issues. The offered to send out a new clean team an repeat the job at no charge. Too late!! We were on a deadline, and the house was full of furniture and boxes!!!

I would have given them 5 stars except for the scheduling miscommunication. Expected the crew to return the next day. When they didn't show by midday I called, got no answer so left message. Called two more times that day with same outcome. I called next morning and was told they were scheduled by 10:30. They seemed unconcerned when told about the previous day's experience and only offered an apology with no explanation. Therefore, what was a great experience with the service was spoiled by poor management communications.
Update: Answering or returning phone calls continues to be a problem. A week before before the labor day weekend GP called to schedule the beginning of our biweekly cleaning. I thought it too soon to begin, so she said she would call ""next week."" It's Wednesday and still no call back. I called this morning, no answer and by 3:00 still no call back. Called again, still no answer. Left message. I have reduced star rating to 3 stars.",,"{'time': 1561497343546, 'text': 'We are Under New Management now.

110555901935191234480,Amanda Schweitzer,1525996233994.0,1.0,"Yikes! Where to begin? When we arrived we were greeted by the hostess. We said we had 3 people and a baby who needed a highchair. We requested a table. She looked around the restaurant puzzled and then checked her seating chart. She did this about 5 times. There were maybe 6 tables taken IN THE WHOLE RESTAURANT!!! Finally she looks at us and says, ""table or booth?"" I couldn't believe it. I thought she was looking around the empty restaurant for the perfect table for us, guess not lol. So we are seated and order our drinks. The waiter was nice enough. We asked for a couple more minutes to decide. A half hour later he came back to get our orders! I wish I was kidding. We ordered an appetizer which took about 30 minutes to come out. It was fine when we got it, nothing spectacular but we were so hungry at that point we probably would have eaten just about anything. I notice the table next to us is having issues with their food coming out cold and then being sent back and never coming out again. I start looking around and see there are other people complaining about wrong food, cold food, etc. When I ordered my food I requested no ranch on it because I am lactose intolerant. We finally get our food after 45 minutes at least. Honestly we were just going to leave but my son really wanted to stay because they have yogurt and strawberries there and it's his favorite. Well the food comes out and mine is drenched in ranch, my son has literally a spoonful of yogurt and my husband's burger is nothing but grease. Our waiter goes MIA yet again so I flag down another waiter and ask for more yogurt for my son. He actually comes right back with it and apologizes! In the meantime the manager comes over and apologizes for the really long wait and says our meal will be free. I send my food back so they could fix it and I never saw it again. The manager went around to every table and comped everyone's meals because the service was so terrible. There was an excuse about the night shift cooks coming in and things got messed up or something. In my opinion that's a piss poor excuse. My husband and son ate and we left. We said we would give it another try at first but we won't. After we left we just got even more mad over it. There was no attempt to make things better just, ""here this meal will be free."" The manager also lied to me which really made me mad. The waiter came out of the kitchen and told me he went to check my food and it wasn't back there then the manager walks over from another table 5 seconds later and says that she just saw my food. We are letting our friends know to avoid this place. After about 3 hours we finally left. It was the worse dining experience I have ever had.",,"{'time': 1526272208273, 'text': ""Amanda we agree that the experience you had is unacceptable. Please give us a call and ask for a manager.

I ordered a corn dog with a side of broccoli for my 4 year old and that's exactly what she got. A huge white plate with a tiny corn dog that rolled around on the dish and an unseasoned un-entertaining bowl of cold hardened broccoli. For myself, a chicken and shrimp skillet dish. It was over seasoned and hard to stomach. My husband ordered a steak dinner. The protein was decent yet again they struck out with a side of broccoli and strange tater-tots. I give 2 stars only because the dining area and bathroom was clean. The waitress seemed very annoyed with her job in general. I don't necessarily expect a bubbly personality, but a nicer tone of voice will go a very long way.

My recent experience centered around their Ribeye which was prepared to a perfect medium rare.  Excellent marbling in the beef and seasoning to bring out all the flavor in a great cut of beef.  They graciously allowed me to swap mashed potatoes for fries - I love steak and fries.   The mixed green side salad had a wonderful honey basalmic vinaigrette and was a very reasonable portion.

Scott behind the bar pours excellent cocktails. The Manhattans (yes plural) we enjoyed had the nice touch of Morello cherries.

I took my son into urgent care last week (right when they opened) for a possible collarbone fracture. They had us checked in within a few minutes and sent us up to Urgent Care where the nurses and other staff were waiting for us to put us in a room. Our NPRN Kristin Nguyen came in almost immediately and she was phenomenal! She was attentive, listened to everything and even watched the video of the wrestling injury. She sent us straight to radiology (those ladies are so great too) who also got us right in for an xray. As soon as we made it back to the room, she was ready to go over the xray with us! No surprise it was broken, but she really was there for us professionally and emotionally. I didn't feel like we were run of the mill patients, I felt like she really cared about my son and his situation and genuinely wanted to help him. We were in Urgent care for under 40 minutes! Had we gone elsewhere we would have been in the waiting room for over 40 minutes before actually begin seen. FFW 10 days and we went to see Dr. Cummings DO in sports medicine. Check in was a breeze with the Kiosk, the staff at the front desk were so sweet, welcoming and warm. Dr. Cummings was also so amazing! Again, we didn't feel like we were ""just patients"" or that he was disinterested because it was a minor injury. He took the time to sit and talk to us about all our questions and didn't rush through it.  I dont think we'll ever go anywhere else. Thank you SJ UofU, you all are super amazing, helpful and genuinely good humans!",,,0x8752856e363d36e3:0x806cbcf96b8c92ef,,,,,,,,,,,,,

114471617747944839609,amanda collins,1539030537207.0,1.0,"i am so appalled and dissapointed with my experience at this place. let me explain

i took a home pregnancy test &it came back positive, what is supposed to be a really special time in my life was COMPLETLY ruined by this place. i wanted to get in THAT day to take a blood test to confirm the pregnancy, my primary doctor, Dr Eli was not in until the next day but i didn‚Äôt want to wait so i went with whoever was in, which was Dr Nimer. i always prefer to be honest about everything when visiting the doctors, which Dr Eli did make me feel comfortable doing. i thought i could do the same with Dr Nimer.. i let him know that before i had found out i might be pregnant, i smoked marijuana. i made it very clear that i had not smoked since i saw that positive test, nor did i plan on smoking again. he immediately left the room and came back to tell me he had made an appointment for me- WITHOUT EVEN CONSULTING ME FIRST- with an obgyn who specializes in drug addiction. i was severely confused, as i am NOT a drug addict. i went along with everything he was saying because i‚Äôm not a confrontational person. after being lectured, i finally got to take a blood test which is the ONLY reason i came in in the first place. this entire appointment ended up costing me 200$. and i still can‚Äôt figure out WHY because all he did was make me feel like a drug addict, took a blood test, and then made another appointment with an obgyn who specializes in drug addiction without even asking me first. fast forward to that night, i look in ‚ÄúMyChart‚Äù and i see that Dr. Nimer put in my notes ‚Äúreports that she uses drugs, including marijuana‚Äù. even after i passed every single drug test-except cannabis. i am now afraid that CPS or someone can see that and use it against me to take away my child, even though i made it CLEAR that i had not smoked since i found out, and i didn‚Äôt plan on doing so again.

at 5 weeks pregnant, my preferred obgyn i wanted to see wouldn‚Äôt take me in this early, and i desperately wanted to make sure everything is where it‚Äôs supposed to be, and receive some prenatal care tips. so i went to that appointment Dr Nimer had scheduled me without my permission because they were the only ones that would see me so early in. i knew i would regret it. i saw in MyChart that it was going to be an ultrasound- i was SO excited. we did an external ultra sound and i got to see the little sac. the sonographer then continued to prep for a transvaginal ultrasound. this is what i was waiting for, i knew i probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to hear or see anything since it was so early, but there was a small chance that i‚Äôd be able to- so i was excited. the sonographer did not make sure the plastic that goes around the thing that is supposed to go inside of me, was flattened and smooth, therefore there was bumps and corners of plastic sticking up, once we started the process i explained that it was hurting me and poking me. right then she took it out and told me to put my pants back on and she left the room without saying another word. she didn‚Äôt even check the stick thing to try and find out what exactly was hurting me, she just left. i was in this room ALONE for about 20 minutes, freaking out and on the verge of tears because i thought maybe she had left because she saw something bad. finally a different woman comes in and puts me back in the waiting room- again without saying a word.i get brought back in to see the obgyn. still nothing in regards to what had just happened in the ultrasound room- she wasn‚Äôt even aware that i had got the ultrasounds done already. they tried getting me to sign papers to start ‚Äútreatment‚Äù, and had a social worker interview me. never even got my due date. once again i felt judged and like a drug addict. i went home to see i was charged 600$ for that ‚Äútransvaginanal ultrasound‚Äù that the sonographer stopped in the middle of. 600$ guys. 600$ for something that HURT me and i didn‚Äôt even get to see. i will never be going back here, and i will forever advise people NOT to come here.",,,0x8752856e363d36e3:0x806cbcf96b8c92ef,,,,,,,,,,,,,
112583107435153921638,Jonathan Rogers,1523336283208.0,1.0,"I need to warn you all about a physicians assistant named pamela neilsen...a grad from a questionable school who likes the sound of her own voice over questions such as ""why are we seeing you today?"" And ""what are your symptoms?"" In order to help ascertain a diagnosis. I went in asking for a doctor and unfortunately only pamela was there.  I had a bacterial sinus infection needing antibiotics,  something I had caught from travelling on a plane and though I had the same exact symptoms as a previous sinus infection from a plane trip, rather than discussing it, I was shown the door with a cough syrup prescription instead of what I needed.  It's been over 2 weeks and symptoms persist...all messages requiring pamela to respond have gone unread by her.  There are medical assistants who try to help and are doing her job for her,  yet she still remains evasive and won't commit to a follow up where she'd have to actually do what she should have done in the first place.  I'm not sure why the university of Utah south Jordan clinic Hires such inept unqualified staff as they have real doctors who are great. If you end up going there,  be sure to deny seeing this pa...It'll be the best thing you do for your health during the visit.  Ask for a doctor,  a nurse,  a pa...just not that one.

Not only did I feel huge relief in less than 24 hours after getting adjusted, I felt like I was in the hands of a very professional, knowledgeable and friendly health care provider. I found it refreshing that Dr. Weed employs a holistic approach to health - your spinal health directly effects your body as a whole (aside from symptoms like back pain).  Before getting any spinal adjustments, x-rays will be taken of your back. I appreciated that - it made me feel like Dr. Weed wanted to be absolutely sure about the structure of my spine before making any adjustments.  Also, they are upfront about the costs. Needless to say, I highly recommend Dr. Weed at Catalyst Chiropractic.",,,0x54ae54c805bc1c15:0x59f78351d375fa39,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I came on time for my appointment but waited 20 minutes before being introduced to Dr Sooria. I did not complain because I know that doctors sometimes are hold with patients. So when they called my name and it came in the room, he barely say Hi, asked me really angry why I was late and when I told me I was not late but was on time and waiting in the waiting room, he answered aggressively why I did not make a complaint to the office manager! How I am supposed to know why am I waiting !
He then told me that I have to reschedule because he has only couple of minutes for me since I was so late! He barely listen my health story, told me I have too much health issues to review and had no time for that and it will fill my pre authorization for my  medications at my next appointment! Medications I need to stay alive!
As said it was my first visit with this doctor, my husband had an appointment for the following week but no need to say that we both cancelled all the appointment and made a change to see another PCP in a different center.
With his rudeness and attitude, he just lost 2 new patients!",,"{'time': 1600290979130, 'text': 'Hi Danielle-I wanted to reach out and apologize for any miscommunication on our end as well as the experience that you had with our office.

103667131030473752651,Nathaniel Kraft,1478897498258.0,5.0,"Black Cat Coffee is now a neighborhood institution for Deering, Libbytown, and beyond residents of Portland, ME. Owned and operated by a local family, this cozy little coffee shop (and ice cream parlour!) is a favorite place to visit. They serve  terrific, locally roasted coffee (Matt's Wood Roasted Coffee); many wonderful pastries made in-house by Jenny; Little Bee Ice Cream (also made in-house by Jenny, with locally sourced honey as a prime ingredient); and soups from Karmasouptra (another Portland institution).

In addition to traditional drip coffee (decaf, mid/light roast, and dark roast), they operate a full espresso bar. You can get your traditional espresso, latte, or chai, or--if you've the need to indulge your sweet-tooth-- you can sample one of their many tasty, flavored lattes. The Nutella Latte is a personal favorite, but I also really love the Sock Saunders dark roast coffee.

Beyond the regular coffee shop nuance, Black Cat also boasts its very own ""Little Free Library,"" where you can borrow or deposit books of your own for sharing within the community. This is in addition to the very full bookshelf for on-site reading, and the many games for kids and adults alike to borrow while they're enjoying their snacks and beverages.

Simply put, Jenny and Keith have brought a real gem to the neighborhood. Stop by, say hello, grab a coffee and a treat. You won't be disappointed.",,,0x4cb29b97f7049797:0x5fa5f8b0270422d2,,,,,,,,,,,,,
