Original post: I used to order here weekly, but since new ownership only a few times because the crust on the pizzas have been underdone. The crust on the bottom of pizza should be at least golden brown, not completely white like the pizzas I have received. I keep going back because they have the best sauce in town and I keep hoping the crust issue will be resolved. This time I ordered a stuffed crust pizza and along with the completely white crust the cheese in the stuffed part wasn't even fully warm or melted. A little disappointed in this order. However their toppings and sauce and customer service are great!",,"{'time': 1570239153228, 'text': 'Sorry to hear of the issue and thank you for the info.

I know at times it can be very busy for them but it's no excuse to hurry up and cook the customers food to the point it's not well done and then it's very cold once getting it. I think the customers should be able to eat nice hot well done foods they pay for. I am very upset with this order tonight.",,,0x883c7c73e0bf64ff:0x7633d2b15bfcdc6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

108578270467053303984,Brier G,1553822031011.0,3.0,"Well I had an appointment at 2pm to just fix a tire that was loosing air... I got there 10 minutes early. It took an hour for them to fix the tire.... I wasn't too please with how I get there early and they don't even touch my vehicle until 30 minutes after our scheduled appointment, if I came 30 minutes late they would have just turned me away. They were extremely busy, the phone was constantly ringing, people coming in. It was only a Thursday. Guess that goes to show how popular they are. When I walked in I was grossed out by how dirty the entire waiting facility was.... the floors, walls, chairs hadn't seen a cleaner in years... I'd be afraid to bring kids in the waiting are it was just soooooooooo dirty... so dirty... They allowed someone to bring their dog in and run loose throughout the waiting area. I personally don't care, but I could see the discomfort of one guy when the dog came up to him. As far as pricing goes they were very fair. I would go back only because of the prices. That is probably why they are so busy all the time. But if you're looking for a clean, and organized place then I'd look elsewhere. If I were the owner I'd be embarrassed to let customers in and see how disgusting it was. Other than that I would still go again. Attached is a picture of a chair and wall pillar that were just gross.",[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOn8sJZRW_pgj8H8A1By729SnPuSFVSDDkQQpzc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}],,0x88069f13d6681423:0x3e2b030047baa400,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But I never go back because I've already left that side of town and don't go back that way for weeks sometimes.  But this past wash was terrible.  I have a Tacoma truck which isn't a huge truck. They didn't even touch the middle half.  It was clean on the outsides and dirty in the middle. But I blamed that on the car wash itself not the people.  Then I looked further and found the bugs still on the windshield and stuck to the bumper.  The dash has clean steaks in it like they rushed it,  which is strange because it took 45 minutes to do.

I discovered it through their food truck - which was my very first experience with Hawaiian food, and I've never looked back. I tend to always get the kalua pork and cabbage, which is this amazingly fatty slow roasted pork with cabbage. It is amazingly delicious (but oh so unhealthy - still you only live once!). My husband gets the hulihuli chicken which is kind of like teriyaki chicken. Their restaurant is kind of small but cute (probably would be difficult to seat a large group), and they do have parking on the side. They also do take out orders.
