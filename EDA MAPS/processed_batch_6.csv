They were able to restore our pool surface to a normal color and provided good inputs on how to better maintain and care for our pool.

Not only do they do an excellent job, but they leave you information each time about what was done to your pool.  I have had problems in the past getting someone to repair an item on the pool.

They were a bit salty when I expressed frustration... saying the heater not working wasn't their fault... even when it was a component that was installed too close to another (which they installed/sigh).  Their solution was to order more parts for it...
Ended up calling Ambiance Pool and they fixed it in 20 mins with no extra parts needed.  Can't recommend.",,,0x86d60c7aaaaaaaab:0xbf3c95a4e31d46c0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I can honestly say that Bluepoint Pool Services was a pleasure to work with.  Lee was very helpful on the phone, and scheduling/payment was a breeze.  The gentleman who came out was honest and sincere and had many years experience.  They replaced my filter and pump with top of the line equipment and the install was perfect and clean.

The technician also recommended ways to improve the use of pool cleaner by means of a vac mate to maximize water circulation and vacuuming at the same time.

The wine was indeed delicious with a couple stand outs. The atmosphere & ambiance however, were bar none, the best I've experienced of the five wineries I've been too in Palisade.
Staff was friendly, knowledgeable and a delight to talk to.
We will definitely be back.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPP_oezlceHWOtEFjtcFaUcqPKpYXqc6MOYAJiV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMmZvVTDnda1YwlKmtYdFE5YM3NJ7ybZKXSii3w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMn8j0Fk_UOmdf52Wh-u8KQ77k28HWF9ibUVHZ1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7hL4aYS9-pwSbYwWUhAjtQ0HAf3tvi6xC61JQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPPtkJORlMP2Im9SRBhqZgtwWpxqY6u4ufAXTol=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",,0x874726ce8f442059:0x24e95981bb9a4af2,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We spoke in both English and Spanish to confirm.

The gal was not helpful when we were trying to order... it was almost like she was laughing at us when we asked questions about a dish. One member of our party just gave up and ordered what she thought.  It was a very odd experience...

When our food finally came out, 2 of the dishes were not what we expected, but we ate it all anyway.  After waiting over 45 minutes to get the food, it wasn't worth talking to her about it.  Also... the prices on the menu did not match the prices we were charged.  It wasn't a huge discrepancy, not worth the effort to bring it up and wait even longer to pay the check.

If I'm paying for my food to be picked up it's for a reason not to wait 45 minutes after.

Being a waitress in the past myself I treated everyone equally and I know what customer service is. These waitresses gossip the whole time your there they get mad because they are working.

I shop here regularly and I love working with everyone in the store, they take time to talk with you and learn what you like.  The meat counter folks always cut my meat to order, if I want it cut or wrapped separately they do it. The deli counter folks are always helpful and will offer to let you try things before you buy. They have so many meal deal options, just ask and they will help you save money and get more for your dollar.  Every week they feature a special family meal, it’s always a good value and plenty of leftovers.  I even have my regular cashiers I like to visit with like Karen or Kerry. They are so nice and always talk to me. I even broke my foot this past winter and they asked about how I’m doing now.

Produce is over priced and not ripe; the sushi is overpriced and mostly rice, actually way too much rice; and several of the employees are rude, impatient, and inconsiderate. A lady at the deli engaged in a full conversation with another worker while I just stood there waiting for my cheese to be sliced. They both looked at me and continued to talk. What a shame. There are other uncomfortable situations to name as well. Not sure if there is new management or something as that can change the atmosphere of the store but it's unacceptable and not worth the extra dollar. Please improve and treat every customer with respect and how you would desire to be treated yourself. Thanks.",,"{'time': 1555428834437, 'text': 'Meagan Larison, we always want your experience to be perfect and we are sorry that we failed to deliver on that.

I schedule my package for pick up because they couldn’t deliver it since I wasn’t home. I go to pick it up and they have no idea where it went and tell me I’m confused and “there’s no way to schedule a pick up”
I showed them the confirmation email and she just shrugs like she doesn’t care and says I don’t know what that is.
They say they’re redelivering it (without my permission). I explain I work and that’s why I was trying to schedule a pick up and she just keeps arguing with me saying I can’t do a pick up. I tell her I’m confused how this happened since I have a confirmation email with confirmation number saying USPS RECEIVED YOUR REQUEST TO PICK UP YOUR PACKAGE AT THE POST OFFICE.  She just kept dismissing that and telling me I’m confused and they will “try” to locate the package.
I ask what happens if you try to redeliver again and I’m not home? Then can I pick it up?
She then kept arguing with me being defensive saying I don’t know where it is or when we can find it. She kept arguing and all I was asking is can I pick it up?

If the representative actually listened to me and wasn’t so rude and argue over everything it wouldn’t be that big of a deal but she was horrible. I wasn’t expecting this to be so complicated with horrible service.",,,0x87528c3a3c5eef47:0x6de2ac4b0d5d39c2,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My Husband was not informed of this hold.
The lady at the Post Office told my husband that he could not pick up any mail because I had put it on hold.
When he inquired about the hold the lady spoke out loud to him that it was because I was getting a DIVORCE!
When he got home he was livid!
I told him that that was not the reason for me putting it on hold.
That was Saturday Febuary 24th, 2018.
I went into the Post Office to inform the same lady clerk that she needed to keep that kind of sensitive information private.
I was very nice to her and wanted to impress upon her how dangerous that could be for a woman.
Instead of saying that she was sorry, she was very defensive and I don't even think she realized the danger that she could have caused!
All that I wanted to do was impress upon her how HER actions could put someone in jeopardy.

I neglected to update my zip code on an order, this is my fault, completely.

What is out of my control, however, is USPS receiving the package and, instead of leaving a note or making it possible to pick up the package from their local office which is less than a mile from my home, they immediately return the package to the sender, after it has already been in transit for 2 weeks.

Is this passive-aggresive paperworking really the best way to notify customers of your changing policies?

Thanks USPS, I'd give 0 stars, but you earn one for being a building that does indeed have mail inside of it.",,,0x87528c3a3c5eef47:0x6de2ac4b0d5d39c2,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I first breifly talked to Norm at the front desk and was not impressed with his attuide toward me needing tape to secure my label i was only their for a few seconds and i felt like it was hostel. I ended up using a piece of tape they had on the table to stick on the back of the label and waited in line. This time i dealed with Matt which from the second i came up was extremely rude. Matt wanted to charge me 4 dollars and change becuase i used the wrong tape. Matt at the front desk was still being rude and an ugly look on his face when dealing with me.  I told Matt for his name and manager's name and he started yelling in the back for someone and was saying how this customer outside(which was me) i can't remember what he said because i was embarrassed at that point and already started walking out. While walking out Matt contuied to yell from his desk at me said have a great day.  Matt knew he was being rude and a bully even after walking away he found it ok to try and embarrass me more.
I ended up going to the west valley location and had not one problem the lady even taped up the sides of the label without me asking. I felt a little better just with how she handled me and made me feel.
Hope this helps someone make a better choice on what location to go to and better train your front desk people how to deal with customers. Some people are not people freadly and need to be around customers. Thanks",,,0x87528c3a3c5eef47:0x6de2ac4b0d5d39c2,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I knew I couldn’t afford a problem but I couldn’t afford a bigger problem either so I got on the phone and said, this is what it sounds like...the gentleman on the other end of the line said, “drive right here, slowly if you can. It sounds like your wheel is loose.”

😳 I pull in, they checked it, not that...so they said, do you have a minute? I said yes, so I pulled in and not 10 min later, I had an estimate...wheel bearing. 🤢

Apparently if you drive on this for too long it can seize up...that’s bad. Les Schwab not only got me in the very next day (tomorrow) first thing in the morning but gave me a fantastic payment plan that not only helps me financially but will help me build my credit! 👍🏻

Thank you to the team at Les Schwab on Government Way, this is the second time I’ve gone to them in a panic and they not only fixed the problem but did it fast and for a good and fair price.

She only has 45k on the car and most of it is highway so I didn't think she'd need new rotors, but I pulled out the micrometer and checked and they were closer to the factory width than the minimum, so I told her to get quotes for the brake pad replacement only.  The guy she talked to at Les Schwab must have assumed that she didn't know what she needed, because he told her that for liability reasons, they have to change the pads, rotors and calipers if they were to do a brake replacement.  For anyone reading this that was told the same thing, this is 100% not required. I wonder how often they take advantage of women/men who don't know any better and sell them hundreds of dollars of unnecessary repairs.  If Les Schwab says you need repairs you didn't know about, do yourself a favor and get a second opinion.",,"{'time': 1564788782895, 'text': ""We are sorry to hear about this, Edmund. We do not recommend replacing rotors with every brake job. Depending on the minimum thickness requirements set by the manufacturer, we are also able to resurface rotors as well. We do recommend replacing calipers when servicing brakes, as the caliper itself has wearable items, as well as the dangers of pressing the piston back inside the housing. We also offer one of the best warranty's in the industry, backing our service and material for 36 months or 25,000 with a 100% parts and labor warranty.

This time though, my visit was riddled with miscommunication from the moment I checked their hours online (which are wrong on their Google page). It was just a simple swap over to my summer wheels and tires that Les Schwab has done a hundred times. I live 30 minutes out of town and organized rides to and from work to the store in order to get it done. They call around 45 minutes before my car is supposed to be done and let me know that I need new rear tires (somewhat expected), so I said to go ahead and throw the same ones on the back that they put on the front in October. No problem. Then about 20 minutes later, I get another call that they can't put the wheels on my car without pressure sensors. The kicker about this is that the sole reason I started going to Les Schwab was because they have always installed my wheels and tires without sensors. That's why I go there. So now my simple wheel change-over has turned into a $600 bill. Considering I am getting rid of my car in just a few weeks and am keeping my summer wheels, I refuse to pay to put Hyundai sensors in them and pay again next month to put BMW or Infiniti sensors in them.

I admit I lost my cool a bit here out of stress and frustration (not all Les Schwab's fault), and I feel bad about that. I said to forget the sensors and just leave the tires on and I'll put the wheels on myself. About 30 minutes later, I go to pick up my car and they had misunderstood and put my other old tires back on. I was annoyed and late for a meeting, so I just said to forget it, I'll figure out the tire and wheel situation on my own.

I don't want Les Schwab to get the full blame for this situation, because I understand that communication is a two-way street. My irritation here comes from the fact that they have *ALWAYS* installed these same wheels and changed tires on them with no issues in the past (without sensors), and yesterday I wasted my entire day without a car, was late for a meeting, and STILL had to go get a floor jack and do it myself and am running bald borderline dangerous rear tires that are going to need to be changed again. I waited to write this review until today so I was a little less heated about the whole thing, but it's definitely taught me that I need to stop trying to pay for convenience and just do this stuff myself.",,"{'time': 1553619984777, 'text': ""I'm sorry to hear this, Justin.

I'm pretty sure that the amount of products they have in stock which feature the f-bomb make this store Rated R.  I was looking for a coffee mug for a gift and essentially gave up as there was no place my eyes could rest where I wasn't confronted with this vulgar term. Sadly, this section of products is right next to their toy section. You literally have to walk right past this section to get to the toys. Really?  What were they thinking? And this was not the only section of the store with vulgar products. Clearly they are catering to customers who lack intelligence and good character.  I'll find my gifts elsewhere in town and pass on this assault. Sad. This store used to be a favorite. Parents who care about their kids should avoid this store.",,"{'time': 1524761842530, 'text': ""Hello Susie!\n\nThank you so much for your review!  It is a wonderful country we live in to be able to freely discuss our views. I truly appreciate your time writing your thoughts and value your decision not to shop at Zaiser's.  We all have to have a moral compass.  I very much appreciate yours.\n\nZaiser's does sell a couple companies that have edgy humor.  One is BlueQ and the other is MN Nice Enough.  (Neither of these are at kid level nor in a children's section of the store.) BlueQ is a company we have sold since the late 90’s and MN Nice Enough for a solid year.  They include lots of self-deprecating sense of humor that is not for everyone.  To be fair, they are using words in an ironic, satire manor.  The context is a HUGE part of their success. There are many companies I will not buy from because of their treatment of employees and how they source their materials. I would NEVER sell products that promote discrimination, make fun of individuals beliefs, promote hate, etc.  We all have to have our own causes to fight for!\n\nI receive many more requests to not stop selling BlueQ and MN Nice Enough's line as to not carry it.  Of the 350+ lines I actively purchase from, BlueQ ranks number three in sales just behind Birkenstock and Keen shoes.  (We sold over 6,000 pairs of their socks in the month of July last year alone.)  In it's first year, MN Nice Enough ranked in our top 15.  I could tell you my top twenty sellers in both lines, but I would not want to offend you with listing them.\n\nAll the above said, I don’t choose companies based on profit alone.  BlueQ has a business culture that supports living wages, non-desrimination, hires at risk adults and donates significant money to Doctors Without Borders - https://www.blueq.com/blog/category/things-we-believe/  MN Nice Enough is an equally amazing local company.\n\nI say the above not to change your mind.  I just want to explain a small glimpse of our culture here at Zaiser’s.  We believe life is too sort not to laugh even if it contains a little vulgarity.\n\nHave a wonderful day ~\n\nBiff Ulm - Zaiser's\n\nP.S. - I always believe in win-win situations in life.  I am sure as intelligent human beings we share more in common than not.  One of the joys of being a small business is you can give back and be an internal part of the community to make a real difference.  Zaiser's (and myself) are strong proponents of education, fair wages, equal rights, helping individuals end addiction, and a host of other causes.  I would invite you to contact me at biff@shopzaisers.com at anytime to collaborate with causes we share that are alike to leave the world a little better place than we found it.""}",0x52b6c21bb072ce51:0x5d1423c91b98b5bd,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently we did two party tray orders for birthdays and the quality and flavor was just as on point as the smaller portions.

The Thai tea is also made in house and fantastic. Boba is usually chewy and cooked just right.

107240030177064832528,Randy Wilson,1529847845261.0,5.0,"Some of these reviews are truly pathetic, "" unique sell"" sounds like your selling something alright, hate, really? You accuse a pay lake, it's owners and patrons of being racist? That's pretty sad considering how many African American, Latino, other ethnicity's frequently fish there. As for the complaint. I don't suppose it dawned on you that perhaps you'd gotten too close to someone's spot they were already fishing and didn't want to tangle lines? They complained and the owners defended you being able to fish wherever you wanted even tho you weren't experienced or considerate enough to give others room. I suppose the ""seaweed"" and trees should all be removed just to appease you. And let's not forget, it's stocked weekly with racist fish that only bite white peoples bait yet only ""play"" with colored people's bait and as we all know, a racist fish wouldn't dare let itself be caught by an African American. Your comment is in itself racist, ridiculous, unwarranted, unfair and just shows your own stupidity. The owners provide a safe, clean set of well stocked lakes, stocked weekly as you can watch the videos on their f/b page, clean restrooms, playground, tackle shop, volley ball court and picnic area with shelter house. The owners are very helpful, extremely nice people that truly care about ALL of their patrons. It took us a couple of times fishing there to figure out what bait they prefer, where they hold during the day, at night, depth, and bait presentation. ""Unique sell"", care to guess who helped us figure it out? A very friendly African American lady that has fished there for years. My best advice for you, leave your hatred outside the fence, overcome your preconceived notion of other races, talk to the owners, other people fishing for advice. Learn to enjoy sitting on a bank, pole in hand, relaxing, instead of seeking out unfounded things to whine about then attempting to hurt this business with absolutely false claims of racism, ridiculous. We go several times a year,  Friday or Saturday night as cats feed at night. Better in late evening at dusk. We use strawberry chicken of our making,  mo burger they sell there and catch Everytime. Downside is cleaning all those fish at 3am when we get home.",,,0x88696e1c3296f63d:0x1fbc70b5179372d1,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rice just standard steamed white basmati with no spicing which is standard in good Indian food.  The Lamb is tough which indicates to that it is probably not Lamb.  It may be sheep but its most likely not Lamb.  We asked for medium spicing for all our dishes and they ranged from burn your mouth hot to barely spiced.  The Paneer dishes have very little cheese.

Lamb Madras, and two others that I can't find on their online menu...one specifically was bone-in goat cooked with rice and herbs...think Indian Goat Jumbalaya, but full of bones.

We will never spend another PENNY in this store where they check a $5 bill.and 2 $1 Bill's to see if counterfeit (umm,  yeah, not kidding) because the man paying for $7 of items has tattoos and a Metallica hat on. Four other people in front of him and the lady cashier used a marker to check 3 small Bill's. Seriously Fresh Thyme??
You can forget any praise given before and know that a big, white man with tattoos and a hat on doesn't shop with ""fake bills"". I'm pretty sure the manager knows exactly about this instance. Judge people for their looks, you lose business! I'll tell everybody I know not to shop there.

I would have given 5 stars IF their salad bar area had FRESH CRISP lettuce, spinach and spring mix. But unfortunately,  they failed in that department.  They also carry too many processed and frozen foods which reminds me of Whole Foods (aka Whole Paycheck) and staff seem to be in the way of shoppers stocking things every time I've been here.  The crispy spicy imitation crab sushi roll was excellent and beat Krogers price by almost $3! I haven't tried this new brand of hummus yet but it looks better than my usual, higher priced brand.

Note that everyone I spoke with, said they would refer my request to Dr. Ibe. There should be some type call history, since I called at least 10 times, and only got through a total of 3 times.What was her point of bringing this up? Was it to confirm that no one in that office does their job? I did indeed call but that seemed to be more important than the concerns I had about my prescription.

Couple tables left without ordering. Our order came with the hardest meat came out first. The side rice was tbe first thing that came to the table. And the last thing that came was an tuna melt sandwich. Which at first it came as an plain grilled cheese sandwich. Returned it and they mixed tuna cold and readers it into the grilled cheese sandwich. Mind you this meal was for my pregnant daughter in law.

Their saimin is my comfort food - with ""choke"" mustard, because I like it when you can actually taste it and it makes your nose run just enough! I don't stray from my usual saimin with side shrimp tempura, but my kids like the cheeseburger and fries, and my man likes their combo plates (and green river!). The last time we were there, they didn't have their yummy cone sushi, and I don't know if they still offer it, but that was always my mom's favorite. The older aunties are just friendly enough to not make you feel uncomfortable and they're pretty efficient too. The parking isn't great, so you have to time it just right - we usually go at those weird in between times. I'm pretty sure there's at least one handicap parking stall. Ps. The bathroom is outside of the restaurant and you need to ask for a key. Oh!

So...in a pinch for time and craving Snoopys, I went back to the one on Wakeforest and Whitaker Mill..... service wasn't friendly and the fries were over cooked and cold. They threw the patties in the container so it was like getting a pizza delivered with the box upside down. After our food was handed to us, the guy quickly closed the window and turned his back.

The shave soaps themselves smell nice on the puck but after lathering and application the scent fades quickly, some people prefer light scents so I am ok with that, its just not my preference.

My issue is with the performance of the shave soap itself.  It is difficult to load on a brush and to get sufficient lather for a good shave.  It is also missing much of of the slickness and cushion that most good shave soaps exhibit.

I really want to try some of their other bath bars as other have expressed that they are top notch but I will not be buying the mens shave soap line again.",,,0x87df2e54a96f622f:0x1d07fcbe58e086df,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We experienced a problem with enough air conditioning reaching the master bedroom. We had to rely on the ceiling fan to attempt to get us to a more comfortable temperature. Their installation of a return in the bedroom, which in turned was jumped to a new vent in the hallway was the perfect solution. In the process of this installation they  found that one of the ducts which supplied the bedroom had totally collapsed. Airflow into this bedroom is now outstanding. We really appreciate their conscientious and customer focused approached to servicing our HVAC system. Tanner was the first representative of Mountain Peak Air to come to our home. Because of his consistent outstanding work and dedication to the highest standards of quality  we have always requested that he come whenever we need HVAC support. Last summer he determined that our Lennox air handlers came with a very sophisticated air filtration system whose filters needed to be changed only annually. He went out of his way to provide the model number of these filters so I could order them then installed them once received.  I cannot say enough great things about him.  Cudos to Mountain Peak for their excellent customer service, and, for having hired Tanner as a member of their team!",,,0x872baf46dd37fa13:0xec3945716f747dbc,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am writing to express how pleased I have been with them Window Tinting and ClearBra the staff at the Littleton has done for me.   I have trusted Jared, Jesse, and Moses (Mo) to the tinting and paint protection film on all of my cars.   Jared, Jesse, and Mo are superb craftsmen, meticulous, and thorough.   They are detail driven, professional, knowledgeable, and friendly.  When I first came to RM Window Tint, it became immediately obvious the staff approached each car as if it was their own. Their goal was to exceed my expectations of the quality of the installation.   Needless to say, on each of my 4 cars they worked diligently to insure I was completely satisfied with the work done.

The staff at RM are experts at helping you choose the tint that will bestsellers meet your needs.   Specifically, the best color, heat rejection level, and whether it be dyed/metallic/ceramic design.   The result is a flawless installation with no creases, bubbles, or peeling.

This is also the case for their paint protection/ClearBra installation.  All edges are tucked, with no visible seams, or creases.   Their ClearBra is virtually invisible!   You can rest assured your car's value will be enhanced and protected from rock chips, dings, tree sap, and bird droppings.

I would also like to mention, Office Manager, Stephanie is wonderful!   She is helpful, efficient, returns all calls, and so friendly.   She always does her best to schedule you at a time that works well for you.  Stephanie is organized and works diligently to make sure the installation team begins working on your vehicle at the promised start time.

In short, I cannot say enough good things about Jared, Jesse, Moses, and Stephanie.   I am certain you will be as pleased as I have been with services provided to me for all my window tinting and clear bra needs.  I encourage you to contact them to learn how can they can make your car look better with high quality tint and paint protection installation.

They’re beyond phenomenon, and they definitely know how to take care of you. Due to the damages from hailstorm, I had to get my new windshield tinted again with ceramic film and I had issues with other tint (bodyshop’s fault), but RM took care of me without any hesitation and with most utmost professionalism. I really appreciate their customer service and excellent workmanship on their work.  I’ve been to this same location 4 times. I’ve sent over 3 people to this location, and they have nothing but good things to say. Excellent work at a very competitive, reasonable price and excellent customer service.

Update (04/25/2018): I've had 3 cars done at RM and have zero complaints. Cannot recommend enough.
RM Windowtint is the only tint place in Colorado Springs that carries the Llumar film. In terms of tint film quality, Llumar is the best, and 3m films and few other brand films aren't as good as the Llumar film in terms of durability.
In terms of customer service, they were quick in providing quote and got it done for me in a reasonable time frame for a walk-in.
Additionally, they have freaking awesome snacks and my wife loved it.
With the ceramic film, my wife's 4Runner is not as hot anymore after sitting outside under the sun.

In their defense, this location is usually busy, but I mean... come on! They have to figure out a more efficient way of getting these orders ready. When I go to other locations, they could be just as busy but still manage to clear their lines in half the time.

On a positive note, I've never had my order messed up, or it tasting bad. So, that's probably why I'm still waiting to go to this location.",,,0x871343ae1fe70093:0x41c626c9b19789ca,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aside from that in the daytime the bugs were not a problem at all! The view is incredible especially if your right on the water. Overall a great camping spot.

They do have public showers and restrooms which is a plus. But they don't even deserve a 1 star review. Just a shower curtain for privacy in your stall and you better bring shoes for the shower.

104183801504057271917,Katora Boycebey,1607794819084.0,1.0,"I wrote a review one year ago, but things have changed since then. I've had several issues with this nail salon over the past few months. The one guy that has been doing my nails for the last 3 months is no longer with the salon. The issue that I have is with the woman that works at station number seven. Any time she does my nails I have to micro manage her, which is why I avoided going to her recently until today. I requested a french manicure which was very difficult for her to do. She does not properly apply acrylic and file nails the way they should be. She left nail polish residue around my nails and also did not line up the white tips. She had to redo some of my nails. I had to coach her into how to do my nails step by step. Because I had to micromanage her (the woman that sits at station number seven) I did not leave her a tip. Please go to someone that you trust as opposed to just having anyone do your nails. I will never go back to this salon because not only am I not pleased with the service here, but they also don't take appointments. They are walk-in only and I no longer want just anyone to do my nails. This salon has lost me as a customer. I was a faithful customer for three years now. I will now receive service elsewhere. Please note, because of my dissatisfaction with this service my review rating has decreased from a 4 to a 1.",,,0x89c81c0db3db843f:0x5328457f79e68319,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We ordered a large pepperoni and sausage pizza and an order of breadsticks. Both were amazing! The breadsticks are house-made--crispy on the outside, soft in the middle. The pizza was so flavorful. I even ate all the crust. Employees were all super friendly.

The bar has a good selection but don't order the chicken parmesan, it's my favorite dish but I've never had any this bad. The noodles had a funky texture and taste, seemed like it had been stored for too long. To top the cake, from the dining room I overheard a manager verbally abusing a crew member. I am a huge fan of small family owned businesses because they value quality and typically treat their employees better than the coorperations. This restaurant seems to lack both.

113764805895564687216,Perla Munoz,1620075574220.0,1.0,"Update;  5/3/2021 AVOID keiser at all cost!! My husband fell and cut his thumb on some old metal, we have been waiting 2 hours to be seeing I called to see how much longer this might take being that well hes still bleeding and boy do I regret that phone call..  The customer service reps and so ignorant about their own process policies and even wait times.. Their CS is lacking big time just all around nurses doctors front desk... IF YOU'RE IN PAIN GO SOMEWHERE ELSE IF YOU'RE BLEEDING GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!

waited a few days before posting my review, originally I was angry and I dont want my review to sound like I'm ranting, but I believe more honest reviews are needed on here, my husband works for a union and most of us are requesting to have Keiser be removed as part of our health benefits.

However today they did it again. On Monday I got a reminder for my appointment for today at 8am. I come in and they tell me I have no such appoinment. Really after the fiasco they put me through a few weeks ago and now this?

A few weeks ago I had made a follow up appoinment, requested by one of my doctors based on the time and date of my new appoinment,  I proceeded to make travel plans for myself and 3 other managers at my new job. I am the general field manager for a high profile company, I needed to present a set of new training guidelines and deal with some HR issues in a different state.

One day prior to my appoinment I was called and told my appointment was for that Thursday not that Tuesday like I had originally planned and was told by the person whom I had made the appoinment with. Usually I'm pretty flexible and in the past when Kaiser has changed my appoinments or my sons therapist doesn't make it in it's ok but this time I tried to explain to Tarra and several others whom I was transferred to, that the new time and date would simply not work for me, and every single one just sounded annoyed and even seem very unapologetic for their mistake and even unwilling to hear how this was going to affect my job and why I needed to travel that Wednesday night so a Thursday appoinment was not possible.. (Keep in mind this was a time sensitive appoinment or so I was told by my doctor whom I now don't believe bc according to this department that was not true, and I was told I could do this test anytime that week)  ""Alex"" the department manager whom I was transferred to after speaking to 3 other people decided to hang up on me instead of even trying to resolve my issue, I then called the number on the back of my card and spoke with a much more professional lady whom after speaking to such Alex the manager from the imagine department suggested how to make a formal complaint. I imagine her experience with him must have been just as negative as it was with me. People like Alex whom can't handle simple basic customer service should not hold positions as managers of anything.

I understand things happen I understand doctors and nurses have lives too. However do they understand that so do I? Just don't lie to me don't make it sound that this appoinment needed to be exactly 11 days and make me take antibiotics 2 days before if it's all as irrelevant as the other Keiser members made it out to be.  Be kind to the patient, we understand what we are told, but if soo many different departments say different things and no one is on the same page then we lose trust and in my case I now walk in questioning the ability of every single one of your employees.

If you have the ability to go to a different provider outside of the Keiser facilities. Do so!",,"{'time': 1503618571620, 'text': 'Hello Perla, I’m sorry to hear of your experience and difficulty with scheduling appointments at Westside.

Brought my baby in 4 days old, he needed bili lights, his number was high and had lost a bit to much weight I didn’t know what to expect I was super emotional. Night shift nurses were amazing then day shift doctor and crew comes on and it’s literally night and day. The doctor was condescending, rude and asked me if I needed a social worker just because I was crying and word for word said “do you need to see a social worker if this is to hard for you?” Just because I was crying because it was stressful, I had 30 mins of sleep total and my hormones are out of this world. I JUST gave birth, she made me feel stupid and like she had more serious patients to see, never been treated so condescending. I was baffled at this experience and how I was treated by the doctor. This doesn’t seem like the profession that fits her. They made me feel so awful about my babies weight loss prior to my breast milk coming in and awful I general. They forced my baby to take so much supplement milk against how uncomfortable I was, made him take in triple his intake he had a reflux attack which was so scary, he had been forced to eat to much to fast after I kept saying I wasn’t comfortable . If I had to stay longer I was going to ask for a new provider. KAISER has been just awful and won’t ever forget how terrible this experience was for me and my husband. Bringing your child in for lights is emotional in of itself and rude staff really make the experience terrible.

110839879481819341980,Natasha Hernandez,1602685152046.0,2.0,"The actual service was nice but something happened here that I thought was weird.

My husband and I came in monday morning 10/12/20. (We are a black and hispanic couple). There was a ""wait to be seated"" sign up so we waited to be seated. About a minute or so later... an older white woman came in and said to me,"" Excuse me dear"".. and just walked right passed us and sat at a booth. The woman who was going to seat us looked at her and greeted her.  The waitress apologized to us and said that woman probably didn't see us and that she was a regular....

My issue with this is the fact that regardless if the lady was a reguar or not... she is not privileged over my husband and I to cut in line. She should have waited to be seated especially because she arrived after we did.

Like I said the staff is nice... but to be fair to everyone... if there is a ""Wait to be seated"" sign put up... all customers should wait in line to be seated regardless of who is a regular or not.

My husband and I felt weird about it because WE are regulars too.. but at a different location.. and never ever has the staff let us cut the line for being a regular.

We just felt really weird about it.",,,0x8793f35bc8666c4b:0x7de71d554f2fe883,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was delicious...however it was probably sitting back there a while and she just never checked on it.

She never checked on us about our meals...she never asked about refreshing our bar drinks or soft drinks...she never cleared any plates.  It was only at the end when she saw me talking with a manager (Zach...who was awesome) did she finally show up...and only then to take the completed credit card slip to get her tip.

We even told her from the very beginning that she was going to get a 20% or better tip because my wife and I have both worked in the food service industry ourselves...so we're always generous when tipping.

It's just freaking sad that a great establishment like this has such a poor server representing them!

112578382814199248516,James Kasal,1495450905362.0,5.0,"Pomeroy's spared me a lot of pain during my childhood. Our family dog, Benji, had a hernia and other vets quoted us upwards of $2000 to do the necessary surgery. My parents could not afford that much, so we operated under the belief that soon we would have to euthanize our beloved family pet. As a last gasp effort we set up an appointment with Pomeroy's. Turns out their fee was less than 1/3 of what others wanted to charge and they accepted payments (not sure how they do payments now - this was in the early 90's). Our hound went on to live about 4 more years. Ever since then it is the only place I will take our dog(s).

Some other members of our family had a older, small dog that had a bunch of kidney stones - again, they were quoted outrageous prices at other vet clinics and Pomeroy's saved the day again with fantastic care at a reasonable price. You can really tell that they care about the animals that they look after.

P.S. Giving Pomeroy's 1 star because they are extremely busy is pretty lame. It sucks that they don't have open slots, but that shouldn't be held against them as far as rating their business.",,,0x87f7d551ae30d429:0x725faf2ac8e313d,,,,,,,,,,,,,

101025957906588646435,Master Shake,1511659011824.0,5.0,"Thanks guys for the last min. Help!

And this place was kicking the entire time.. Level 5! One star.. What they didn't have a charger for your Motorola Razer! It's 2017...yeah if your there for the cash in stuff the have then you lost... But us repair guys loved it because... As a Stage Light repair tech.. Sometimes... A lot.. I need it that day.

So, microcontroller... The place to go to if you can not find it locally.. Although there are local shops... I'm still looking and it helps our community..

F Amozombie. Folks you don't want to go and see the merchandise and have the PERFECT option... To return to the store for FREE.

Get off our phones... (hypocritical I know) and go see this world.

I've tried the Amazon, online for certain things... Light parts. Com but dude. The manager was rude... Did you cry? 1 star.. JC!

Also another thanks to that clearance sales RadioShack! I got $900 bucks worth of stuff for $15 dollars....

Too bad you can't merge into a home depot or something... To provide Technicians an option to buy today! Not USPS FedEx or UPS... Yes I will order when I know what I am getting, paying to return! BS

Hope you read this in hopes people go outside an enjoy the days we have fought for..

Also I am Computer Science Graduate and am in training for future Online technologies to come... By by wifi routers... Don't need them already... You got one? If your not a gamer or high volume consumer... Your getting Screwed... Figure out... Mobil hot spots unlimited data and digital TV.... Or keep paying.. $240+Netflix+Whatever.. like I did.

Then pay $60 flat for a year.. My speeds are faster than Comcast. And yes.. I choose to go out into the world.. My opinion not yours.

Good day! Level 5 one star.. Crybaby...

Love Porter😊",,,0x883b374407148e3f:0x29f0717b38c6a435,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had my foot half way amputated,  and I cannot just walk here or stroll there, but the closer I am to coming home, the less the help is willing to help. I called the aid to find out when my bandages will be changed. That was an hour and 20 minutes ago and no one has gotten back to me. I swear if I get infected while in their care, legalities will be administered. I don't make a nuisance of myself and I only call when I need something,  so this behavior towards me is unwarranted.

Family member was experiencing kidney failure and no one on the staff recognized that he was not eating, too weak to move, lethargic, disoriented, in pain and in discomfort. The nurse on duty that night lied and said he didnt want to go to the hospital.

The next morning I demanded that he be released to go to the to the emergency room. A day later at the hospital they had him on dialysis. His kidney have been failing for over an week and the medical staff was clueless.

While in the facility he devloped bed and heel sores from sitting on a bedpan for over 2 hours and from not turning him. They would leave them in a corner of a room in his wheelchair unattended for hours.

When we made the decision to not return to the facility I went to pick up his personal belongings and they had placed them in garbage bags. Really? They can't put the patients belonging in a box or a bag. You store the patients belongings in trash bags, how inconsiderate.

The Frankfort PF is small but in a good way — it’s not cramped, not crowded, not noisy, it’s comfortable to be there. All fitness levels and ages are there side by side, just doing their own thing and worrying only about themselves. Oh and the personal TVs on some of the treadmills are awesome and perfect distance away (not too up in your face).

The staff are generally friendly, and you van tell they are happy there.

Complaints:
There are some safety issues at play here; The safety clips on the treadmills are so weak, that if you were to trip, it would come right off your clothing and fail to disengage the treadmill as intended.

They do not enforce PF dress code. But this is Franfort. Everything's chill, I suppose.

There is a stretching apparatus that you sit on, which has loose bolts and has become very wobbly. I voiced my concerns to the staff, but did not feel like I was listened to, and problem has yet to be addressed.

They play utter junk on the TVs mounted on the ceiling. Just basic TV stations running ads. (Oh my god, the ads.) I feel like I am being brainwashed. At least they could play something pleasing to the eye?

I've had some issues with the Wi-Fi here. It doesn't seem to work for me.",,,0x8842731fbec16321:0x4b98f46e889f7c74,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And in the summer time it can be 95° outside but when you jump in and hit the cold pool of water below it will take your breath away. That running water is so cold coming over those falls.

100901725030145153515,anthony delmasto,1533741387337.0,1.0,Bought a guitar there.  Acoustic Electric.  Took it out of the box over a month later and the electic part didn't work. So I called them and they told me even though I had the receipt since it was over a month they couldn't cover it.  Really?  The guy who sold it to me I figured would of checked it before he sold it to me.  The battery that was supposed to come with the guitar wasn't in the box either.   When I bought the guitar on Memorial Day weekend they also forget to give me the sale discount that was advertised.  So I had to go back in and after about 30 minutes of waiting for them to figure out how to give me the discount they finally were able to fix it.  NO apologies for the waiting or nothing.  They did fix my guitar for nothing cause it ended  up being a loose battery compartment that they rigged with a piece of folded up paper.   Don't know how long that fix will last.  Wont go to this one again.  I will make the two hour drive to the one in Nashua NH who know customer service.,,,0x89e6e0c9d07528d5:0xee5d591194301f89,,,,,,,,,,,,,

116916296624192358577,Nils Hashwi,1545616017789.0,2.0,"I like Guitar Center as a company (minus the scam that is their trash Williams digital piano line), just not this one, especially on customer service.  I have *never* approached the register of this particular Guitar Center *without* being ignored, and I have *never* waited to check out a product here *without* waiting at least ten minutes and without one apology.

I was pushed to write a review after an interaction on 12-19-18 with one staff member, named as ""Alexander J M"", as indicated on my receipt.  I brought in gear that I was offering to sell, and the whole unnecessary interaction that ensued reeked of bad-tempered cattiness (a more common and recognizable term would be more appropriate, but potentially against Google Reviews policy).  While crass, I honestly can't think of a better word to describe this particular staff member besides the adjective form of the parenthetically suggested term, though.

I was in the store a while as my products were tested, which was fine, but I increasingly noticed then that this staff member was particularly averse to smiling, friendliness, or anything beyond few-word, inflection-less explanations.  Once I was rung up, though, the experience only went further downhill.

I waited for about 25 minutes in one spot as the staff member typed and was on calls somehow regarding the amount I was owed.  I was not offered one explanation or apology for my having to wait this long.  In addition, the one question I asked during this time frame, which was if the amount I was owed could be applied to my Guitar Center card, was met with a one-word answer, flat-toned ""no"".  This word was offered without the staff member even turning in my direction, attempting to make eye contact, or pausing engagement with their computer.

During my whole experience with the staff member on 12-19-18, I felt to be an annoying burden treated with disdain.  I understand that in everyday life, we can't expect friendliness from everyone whose paths we cross, but customer service isn't everyday life.  Friendliness––or at least attempted friendliness––should be considered standard for a business that actually wants customers.

I have generally avoided this particular Guitar Center up until now due to the overall sense of feeling unwelcome as a customer.  However, as of now, I will certainly be avoiding this particular store in order to also avoid feeling the disdain of pointless bad-tempered cattiness.",,,0x89e6e0c9d07528d5:0xee5d591194301f89,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are very knowledgeable about the products they carry in their stores and are not afraid to answer honestly if they don't know. Their grooming staff does an incredible job at a very competitive price for the area. did you a wonderful job at leaving the teddy bear look on my little Yorkie. The only downside is because they are so great there is normal a long wait time to get an appointment for the grooming. And the best part is the little messages on their receipts. I love a business who is proud of their faith.,"[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_zny-xaUOX41yReDi_fdMewLZWjSK8tHpCg8j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPbwXPpph-1BC3nh3B-U4BN8TOZvCT3uSyrX3sP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMO5UIyuMRnrAomMNiOYkXXi9HS__ekP4oJV4Sy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPfE1Ya8V8yKLwRPLBKa8jXMwGXdgdMLkahdyWq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]","{'time': 1601414746168, 'text': ""Amanda, we greatly appreciate your kind words and review.

He rushed through the pedicure.He kept trying to get me to get a manicure.  Why? So he could butcher my fingers. No thank you. My daughter's was still getting hers and he kept trying to get me to go to the dryer. I was not leaving my daughter alone. It was her first time getting a pedicure.
