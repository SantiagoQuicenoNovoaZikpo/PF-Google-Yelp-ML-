113439885720143786522,Steve Holland,1528823744253.0,4.0,My friend and I played here today. played all 27 of beauty. Lots of great short par 3s and 4s. My friend has played here a few times so he knew where each pin is. Could use some Hole layout pictures for a couple holes. Some long grass 13 through 23. But nothing terrible that I haven't seen before. Still well worth the 7$ to play. 4 outta 5 stars easily.,,,0x4cb27993a61ab3e1:0xa6c6508fe8842ff0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But Enman Field isn't the same anymore - the state of the grounds is deplorable, the course signage is hard to see/follow, and the parking area has become a dumping ground. With a little (lot) of love, money, and care this could easily be a very good local course - and I will definitely keep my fingers crossed that they get it sorted out ... but until then, you're better off driving a little further away for your fun...",,,0x4cb27993a61ab3e1:0xa6c6508fe8842ff0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was actually scared to be there and my husband and I didn't stay. They have signs when you first drive in make you pay before even driving in or you will be trespassing.

Used to be 2 courses 18 holes each and now just the Beauty which has changed a lot and is a 27 hole course of par 3s and 4s. The $6 was fair to play for the whole day, but I didn't like that children were collecting the money at the honor box. I'm an adult, I can pay without the supervision of 10 year olds, thank you. The course hadn't been mowed in a while, the signs that marked the course were not all there, and the parking lot looked like a dump (literally a junk yard).",,,0x4cb27993a61ab3e1:0xa6c6508fe8842ff0,,,,,,,,,,,,,

107361666382853847606,Marianne Leavitt,1500929278530.0,1.0,"They literally stole my money. I ordered scallops and fries for lunch and it came to $18.00 not including a drink. I got, no joke, 3 scallops and two half peices. I tried one half peice and you could immediately tell it was frozen and had been sitting in water all day waiting to be cooked. I politely asked for my money back, explaining it was not their fault as I'm sure the cook and the servers do not order the seafood. The nasty teenage girls working the register told me I shouldn't have ordered it if I didn't like it. I wanted to explain that I love scallops, but what I was served was garbage, but didn't. They told me I couldn't have a refund with out the owners approval, even tho I paid in cash. They took my phone number and promised he would call, and that was three days ago.

The onion rings and fried fish had a taste of the oil not being changed and the ""full-bellied"" clams were very small and appeared to be frozen and not fresh.  No excuse for a fish place on Portland's waterfront to have frozen fish. Unfortunately, I can't see going back when Benny's no longer lives up to it's longtime reputation.

I did have a form 1098 T from school and I had called H&R block about it because I was planning on filing with them. They told me i dont need it because it was a pell grant and I had been reimbursed for out of pocket funds. When i went to PMC, Michelle was able to get me a couple hundred dollars from the form and i was EXTREMELY IMPRESSED AND HAPPY!!!  The place of business itself has a ""homey"" feel to it...i felt at home and I loved it! It is a family business...everyone is closely related and that is definitely a plus with me. Very personable! As soon as I walked in, I was greeted and offered a drink. I have always filed with h&r block...and after being charged 300+ EVERY time with no discounts for being a regular yearly customer, i am DONE!!! I was charged less than 100!

However, I prefer more flavor. Added the sauces and I wasn’t a big fan of those either. I will say though, because of the natural taste, it did have a fresh feeling to it.

The tortillas on the tacos were thinner and softer than I would have expected, again coming off lighter and not some thick greasy thing which is good depending on your mood. In the burrito, I was pleasantly surprised that it had black beans in it, but I would prefer them cooked a little less firm. There was cheese in the burrito too, but you couldn’t really tell sometimes - which I think is a good thing. It shows that it’s in there as an ingredient to compliment the others and not just filler. It also means that the cheese was VERY melty and almost seemed to blend in with the rice. I thought that was cool. Also the burrito was pretty big, and slightly grilled.

Overall, I’m happy with the service and the fact that the food was hot and the meat was marinated and not chewy. It all felt fresh.

Edit 06.03.21:
Went back this evening for the 5th time. It has been better every time I've gone. I didn't mention before these are full-sized tacos, not the standard smaller taqueria size. I think what sets this truck apart for me is the attention to detail. All of the food is properly packaged and the tacos are individually wrapped. If you call ahead, they'll even bring out your order.

I ordered one of every taco and I loved every one of them. The standouts to me were the Asada, Cochinita Pibil and my favorite; the birria. The birria comes ""a la tuma"" which is when cheese is placed directly on the flat top grill, then scooped up with the tortilla. The texture and flavor give another layer of richness to the overall profile. It's almost cheating and I can get with that. The cochinita is some of the best I've had. Do yourself a favor and bring cash and start ordering everything on the menu.

I actually went in the next day and they raised it by $3000.00  the room they offered for nearly $8000.00 a month was shared by 3 . This place has some rooms 3 persons per room. Admissions takes me to a dark room. 1 lady who had the window side was curled into a ball looking frightened by us being there , remember ,  this room is a 3 person with only curtains divided. The center area would've been my mother's so called bed . And my point is that. ..it was only a tiny bed with a curtain on each side.  No side table nowhere to have any personal things. No room for me to even walk beside the bed. Ok so the admissions is showing me IN THE DARK,  we pass the lady's area in the room which is by the door....the admissions lady says ""I hope your mom doesn't mind,  but this lady doesn't like lights so hope your mom doesn't mind the dark!"" .WOW !! 8,000.00 A MONTH AND NO LIGHTS AND NO TV . it WAS a CONCENTRATION CAMP.  my mom has lost of living to do, so I figured this place is a crypt for those who want to or are on verge of dying.

111729358070247160847,just a nurse,1493318879932.0,1.0,"I'm in the process of purchasing a laptop through Rent-A-Center. The total purchase agreement is 32 payments of $93, I have 7 remaining payments. I guess I somehow missed a payment and my account was 11 days past due. on 4/26/17 an associate came to my home to either collect payment (I'm paid every other week and was planning on making a payment the following day which was payday) or take the computer. Over the span of 6 years, I have given this particular establishment thousands of dollars and paid out at least 8 other agreements that I can think of right of the top of my head without any issue. I was obviously irritated to say the least. I proceeded to immediately make a payment using a credit card (which I try not to use unless absolutely necessary.) The representative then informed me that his manager was on his personal cell phone and wanted to speak to me. I took the phone and the manger stated that she needed a good contact number for me and proceeded to ask me essentially ""what the deal was"" as to why my account had become past due. I told her that I suppose I had forgotten to make a payment and after my years of repeat business I couldn't believe I was being treated this way. I then said that tomorrow when I got paid I would be paying my account in full and would never do business with them ever again. She replied that she had the authority to reverse my payment and seize ""her laptop"" until tomorrow as it's not mine since it's not been paid in full if I couldn't do business on a professional level. She then proceeded to further berate me that in the nature of business if I was late on my electric bill or rent there would also be consequences. She then asked ""so which will it be,"" I told her to do whatever she felt was necessary. She informed me that she would be reversing my payment and confiscating the laptop until tomorrow. She never did reverse my payment and the payment I made had not only brought my account current but paid up to 5/13/17, horrible business practice and treatment. I want nothing further to do with this establishment ever again. Perhaps the ""manager"" I spoke to, Madison or Madeline, should receive further training on conflict resolution and de-escalation rather than antagonizing loyal patrons. It's truly a shame I have to rate this business the 1 star they do not deserve.",,,0x89ca02f58ed507a3:0x745c04d144c64df9,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Oasis Staff will come out on a freezing winters day and help you move your vehicle out of 3 feet of snow, they will do whatever you need when they need to have the parking lot plowed.

113590624663184874829,Elizabeth,1518702092371.0,2.0,"Really beautiful clubhouse and property but the staff is very rude and their location does NOT follow ADA guidelines for those who have a disability. When we tried to find out our options the manager refused to call us back and at one point another woman said she was in the restroom just to avoid speaking with us about a reasonable accommodation. The only request that we had was for them to take out air fresheners from the amenity areas so that I could workout. With my illness I HAVE to workout every day or at least 5 days a week. I have a condition that makes me deathly allergic to any and all artificial scents, so much so that the doctors thought I had a brain tumor. Our apartment complex now removed them after consulting with their lawyers and realizing that it's just an added cost that they didn't need. You'd think that it wouldn't be necessary for them pump toxic air fresheners into the gym, but their response was ""other residents would not be able to fully enjoy the gym"" and that it would cause them financial hardship and too much manpower. Taking air fresheners out to prevent me from going to the hospital would actually save them money and unless their maintenance team has chicken arms it takes barely any man power to simply remove the canister in the wall units.

Very disappointed by the poor treatment of Oasis at Plainville and their refusal to meet ADA guidelines which by law they are supposed to accommodate.",,"{'time': 1519669741957, 'text': 'Hi Elizabeth, I apologize for your poor experience.

He was very responsive and reassured me of all my legal avenues pertaining to my case... I would recommend him to anyone that wants a Experienced and Honest lawyer.,,,0x8836d6da110f4eab:0x9ba62741c87fc215,,,,,,,,,,,,,
111276580848920501572,Steven Draa,1598495106775.0,5.0,"First, let me say that it is very rare for me to write a review for anything, let alone for a person.  I feel like if you pay for something, a service, and you get said service, thats what you paid for.  Well done.  So be it, off to the next thing.

This is one of those rare times.

I found myself in a situation that i never planned on being in, and having never been in this situation, i had no idea how to move forward.....none.  One thing led to another, and i found myself staring at a computer screen with a list of options.  I made a few phone calls, left a few messages and had a few discussions.  They all felt clinical, almost rehearsed.  I was frustrated as i placed my final call for the day and left a last message, expecting more of the same.....

Within fifteen minuets, i received a call from Jamison A. Offineer.  After a discussion that must have lasted an hour, i had recounted my ordeal, and he was giving me advice, and sharing his thoughts about my situation as i droned on.....

Not long after, Jamison agreed to take me on as a client.  Fees were discussed, details given as to what i should expect from said fees, money was sent, and we were off and running......

Here i sit, two months later, my day in court a thing of the past, and i can't begin to tell you what a great experience this bad situation was for me.

Jamison is personable.  He's a professional, but he's a guy too.  Down to earth, respectful,  open, detailed, thorough, direct, but the thing that made the biggest impression is his honesty, his integrity.  I know he could have sold me on the idea of laying down more cash in hopes (real or imagined) of getting an even better deal, but he didn't, and i would have been an easy mark (having never been in trouble like this before).  His honesty and his forthright nature (i say nature because it just felt real....no script, no act....just being genuine) are truly an amazing thing....

It is my hope to never have to pair up like this with Jamison, and i hope i don't need to recommend him to anyone, but if i did need too, i would recommend him without batting an eye.....

He made the process simple to understand and was extremely accommodating....

If you find yourself in need, in a situation that has you scared and nervous, and you have no idea where to begin....pick up your phone.... don't hesitate....call Jamison!!  You won't regret it!",,,0x8836d6da110f4eab:0x9ba62741c87fc215,,,,,,,,,,,,,
101518599043563199440,Nick M,1599890286470.0,5.0,"So, the last 24 hours has been pretty wild for me. I got caught up in a pretty serious jam that could have life changing and not for the better. Luckily for me, it worked out and I was 100% innocent and not at fault, but still very unnerving.

But in the middle of this storm of despair, I was going to need an attorney. I wasn't sure who to speak with so I did a google search and came across Jamison after about 2 or 3 highly recommended attorney's, not only was he the only attorney who picked up the phone, but he was very kind and he eased us into the conversation with care and concern.

Without any ego or ""lawyer talk"", Jamison and I had a consultation that any other attorney would have charged me for and the information and calm he provided me with was not just matter of fact but also honest.

I spoke to a few attorney's after him and I was spoken at, talked at and given information to in a brief discerning, disinterested tone. I knew that If I was going to have to chose an attorney who I was going to pick.

Jamison impressed me so much that I called him back just to thank him for his professionalism and his kindness. If I ever have need to use an attorney in the future, I know who I'm choosing with absolute certainty.

This is the guy you want representing you.",,,0x8836d6da110f4eab:0x9ba62741c87fc215,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not only did he do everything he said he would and explained the process to me in terms I could understand, he had the best demeanor of any of the lawyers I've encountered and his relationship with the court reflected that. My outcome was better than I expected and he even helped me clear up another matter that was unrelated to the case I had hired him for. He's knowledgeable, professional, timely, and in general has a great attitude. Unlike my last attorney, he never used profanity and even took time away from dinner with his family to talk to me one evening because it was the only time I could call him back. Dedicated to his clients would be a understatement of his actions. I highly recommend him as your next attorney!",,,0x8836d6da110f4eab:0x9ba62741c87fc215,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For a couple of months it seemed like a great little company. Then they started sending them home early once in a while for a few weeks then a little more. One even just went through a performance evaluation for his raise. All seemed pretty good still yet something not quite right! So that brings us to today they laid them off right here at almost Christmas!! Beware!!!,,,0x87c87e473635feb5:0x6de42f63fb4ad19b,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’ve had more problems so far with this bank than any banking experience before. I’ve been trying to order checks for 6 months and keep being met with apologies, and “we’ll get that fixed!” only to still be without checks.

Our bank account randomly shuts down access, passwords stop working and can’t be fixed without calling in (today is a holiday and we have to purchase business supplies but with our measly 1500 spending limit we’re basically screwed for business today).

Setting up a new account with business partners as we expand turned into an embarrassing mess, our third partner has still yet to receive the promised emails. Cards couldn’t be printed because all machines had been “down” again so, late for every other appointment that day in a domino effect.

The experience has just been unorganized and unprofessional, it’s a young bank and the downtown location shows off a lot of pizzazz — but it’s hallow.

Being the sole person that had to arrange everything using BTS made the process smooth, easy, accommodating and fantastic. I haven't been skiing in 20 years and this was my first time back with small kids and seniors some who have never skied before. The whole staff was incredible and unbelievably over the top, friendly, helpful and nice. It's rare to find service like this these days. I am a VERY hard customer to please. Nothing EVER goes right for me and being in business for my self I am extremely critical of any little thing that goes wrong, from a crooked uniform, personal appearance, a slip of the tongue, a roll of the eyes, or a hint of a bad attitude none of that was present when dealing with this organization. They bent over backwards in being available, handling special requests, dealing with my problems, last minute changes and making me feel like I was their best and only customer on the entire mountain.

You will have to help yourself until you bother an employee for assistance, only to realize that the employee probably has little to no experience with paint.  I was able to look past the poor customers service because some of our friends had mentioned a few colors from Dunn-Edwards.  We were finishing up a project and I stopped by to grab some swatches, but they had already locked the doors.  It was 12:55 PM according to my iPhone, a very accurate time.  The employee standing there, probably the one who had locked the door, would not turn his head.  I would have been in the store 3 minutes prior, but I had to drive around to find parking because they've marked off about 10 empty spots in the front of their store for ""employees only"".  As I walked to my car, I noticed employees walking out of the back and hopping in their cars, parked in the unmarked spots.  Next time, I'll just go to Lowes.  They carry better paint anyways (Sherwin Williams).",,,0x809b1ff6d3a60c4d:0xdf08e68028807693,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Geoff has been our attorney ever since and he not only looks after our business' legal needs, he's there for all of our personal needs as well. He's meticulous, precise and very professional but at the same time, empathetic and considerate. He looks at the big picture, gives you the right advice and then prepares everything that you need in the most professional manner. He follows up with his clients and keeps his commitments.

The front desk staff is very warm and inviting, and the electronic new patient information is not cumbersome at all. I had a really good experience with the front of the house doing all the administrative stuff.

A lot of people recommend their own dentist when you ask for a recommendation because it is all they know and they have good experiences - fair enough - I had been going to the same dentist for my entire life, and only left because his receptionist has become increasingly rude over the years.

In my opinion, real value in recommendations come from someone who has shopped around and done their research and had multiple experiences across multiple offices.

Here's a testament to Dr. Blake's Skill:
I have been seen by no less than 12 dentists (Army/VA & private sector) who have tried to drill a specific filling because it is ""starting to deteriorate inside/behind the filling""

When I explain to them that it is just the type of material they used, with a little extra bonding that looks like a shadow behind the filling on x-rays and it hasn't changed in years they usually just scoff at me and tell me they still recommend re-filling it, and then I tell them they aren't touching my teeth.

Dr. Blake knew immediately that the filling didn't need to be drilled out and re-done - he explained how he knew that due to the symmetry of the shadow and the quality of the other work and was even complimentary of the work that had been done on my teeth to date.

The dental hygienist was great , with comfortable conversation. They have definitely gained a new and a repeat patient. The whole staff is so appreciative of your business. I really enjoyed my first experience here.",,"{'time': 1564577470710, 'text': 'It is impossible to have a comfortable relationship with anyone in healthcare if you do not trust them.

I love how professional everyone is and it's so clean. When you walk in it's a big open room with separate areas for each kind of service (areas for pedicures, manicures, eyelash/eyebrow/eyeliner procedures, and there is a separate room for other procedures - microdermabrasion, etc)

All of the employees (other than the front desk person) wear a white (lab) coat, there is nice soft music playing while you're getting your procedure done. It's a very relaxing atmosphere.

They are very accommodating too!! My drive to get to Lena's is about 1 hr 15 mins (worth it, by the way!) and I was running late this last time and they made it work for me so I didn't have to reschedule which was so nice.

My first visit, my sister and I went in to get our eyebrows done. I was thinking microblading but Lena suggested some powder shading too (which I didn't even know anything about) my eyebrows were so sparse that the microblading + powder shading made them look GREAT .... AND I got the shape I wanted!! My sister just got microblading since she had more ""eyebrow"" than me.  This saves me SO MUCH TIME in the mornings as I was drawing on my eyebrows every day!!  Keep in mind that the color will be darker for a while until it's healed. I didn't mind how they looked when they were dark and I love how they are now.

My 2nd visit was when we went back in for our eyebrow touchups and we brought our mother-in-law to get her eyebrows done (she has very fair hair for her eyebrows and she didn't enjoy drawing them in) Hers turned out great! She has gone back for 2 touchups since then and even brought a friend with her! In that same visit my sister and I got our touchups and I also decided to get eyelashes - they were long and beautiful!

On my 3rd visit, my sister and I got permanent eyeliner. They put numbing cream on so it wasn't too painful and the results were so pretty!! It does shrink a little after healing so at my touchup (4th visit) she made it a little thicker. I am very happy with the results and will be sure to continue coming back for touchups.

I have been recommending Lena's to all of my friends who are looking to get one of these procedures done! It's a wonderful place, very professional and the environment is so relaxing!

If you're on the fence or thinking about it - just do it!! It's awesome and Lena and her team are GREAT!!

Look at my pics (before/after) it's amazing!!! I couldn't be happier! Thank you Lena (and team)!!",[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSwKTm9Ef-MP6Vx8BHOYIcJMlE5uGjFDM7Bzpa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}],"{'time': 1612019246939, 'text': 'It is awesome.

101471856155148729010,Julie A. Gerber,1628003250740.0,1.0,"Update: Their “reply” to my review amounted to nothing. They never followed up with me. This doctor has left me without medication and not enough time to find a new doctor and get my prescriptions refilled because I came down with COVID. I have been abandoned with no recourse. I will be calling the state to file a complaint and will not drop this. Having to reschedule two to three appointments (appointments were not back to back as I was accused) over the course of two years (with more than twenty four hours notice) is NOT grounds to abandon your patients. I’m still fuming over the male at the front desk who laughed like a hyena when I questioned why I was being dropped. Steer clear of this place.

UPDATE: I followed their link and submitted report. I’ll update here if anything comes from it. Forgot to mention, I was told I missed three appointments in a row by the laughing man on staff. It isn’t true. I missed one because I had been sick and needed labs done before my appointment. I had just seen the doctor and was given new meds at my previous appointment.  I had an appointment already scheduled for September and while I’m waiting on refills, they instead cancel me and remove me as a patient.

Love the doctor but was cancelled  as a patient after calling in to reschedule three (only two with this doctor-one was with previous doctor) appointments (they were not consecutive appointments, and I always called in advance so they could fill the spot) so they have now cancelled my next appointment and refuse to fill my meds. No one notified me. So much for all my family going to one doctor. I now get to move myself, my mom, and my husband to another office. Office manager guy repeatedly  laughed at me when I called to question what happened. As a nurse, his behavior was rude and unprofessional. I loved this doctor and his nurse. It’s a shame I’m punished for doing what I thought was right….. one cancelled for being extremely sick, one because my son was in ICU, and a third because my mom had surgery and I couldn’t leave her…. But they were notified well in advance. I’m angry.",,"{'time': 1627042799532, 'text': 'Thank you for the feedback.

For instance, they once called me an hour before an appointment and cancelled.  Also, they don't do their referrals correctly and just overall seem to hold their patients in low esteem.

Here's an example, I called his office last week with severe back pains and they said it would be 3 weeks before he could see me - that I should go to Urgent Care.  I then called my former doctor and he said come on over - we'll get to you.  That's the difference and that's what you should look for in a PCP.

Revised 07/16/20.  I'm revising this review to a ""5"" because, as I said before, he's a knowledgeable doctor - superb actually.

I've heard that all the office personnel and nurse practitioner have been changed or reassigned.

When asked about the explanation, none was given. No apology, like nothing wrong happened.
I called to DHL on Tuesday and they called me back apologizing, saying the agent (Mail Station) did not handled it right and they are going to ""coach"" them. As I checked the BBB rating of the Mail Station, it's D MINUS - no wonder this is something I've encountered. Mail Station do not care about their customers. I asked Nancy, the employee to ask an owner to contact me to resolve it properly. No one called me. Finally I've confirmed on Tuesday afternoon, that my package was picked ups finally by DHL and it's going to be on it's way.

110135392346519777322,Juanita Aguilar,1524574991535.0,5.0,I've raised 5 children through the care of this office! Dr. Frias and his entire staff are so wonderful! We've been going to both of his offices since 2007. Way back then is when the practice was starting! He still has most of his original staff working there which makes it so comfortable taking my children and my permanent guardian children who were abused there to see any doctor or physician assistants he has and staff and are available to see them. Due to years of going and seeing the same faces in this office years later is very heart warming to me being a mom of a 22 year old girl who was a patient until 19. A 17 year old girl who is very shy is very comfortable tgere.and a 14 year old boy as well and hes alot like his sister. Just when I thought I'd never have kids again God put 2 little Angel's in our hands to care and with the help of APC Pediatrics they are very different children now. Their fears are gone and they are loved! Not just by me but by the entire staff in both offices who know the Aguilars ;-) Highly recommended! Dont go off of comments below from disgruntled parents who have no clue what it takes to run 2 offices at this caliber and still love and care for their current patients!!,,"{'time': 1533077488025, 'text': 'Thank you Juanita, we appreciate you taking the time to leave such a kind review!'}",0x88c33c2935058dd3:0xb888c702ecf5aef6,,,,,,,,,,,,,

117606071928136445011,Anna F,1529925734228.0,1.0,"Let this be a lesson to me to go elsewhere other than my regular place. I just needed a fill in (acrylic). It’s been a month and I was just so busy after work and on weekends that I didn’t have time to stop by my regular place to get my nails done. This salon is near where I work so I figured this would be a real life saver. I just needed a fill in. I made an appointment, stopped by and was seated within a few minutes of arriving. The salon is tiny. There is maybe max six people working there, and it was stuffy. It’s very dated but to get your nails done you don’t need the most luxurious finishes on the wall, so fine. Then the woman who did my nails hurried. I mean ZOOM! As a result, my cuticles died. After a month and good care my cuticles were on point. Healthy, supple, push them back and the nail bed is primed and ready for a fill in, this woman erased my cuticles from existence with the nail dremel. Not intentionally, more like “I don’t have time to worry about them.” Ouch by the way, ouch. Then when she took off the layer of the gel polish that I had on, she used the dremel too and it was so hot that it hurt. Fine, that didn’t last long. Then she shaped my nails (badly, I went home and spent some quality time with a nail file) and did the fill in. Again, sloppy work, I wound up with dry acrylic on my skin that I had to peel off. Then she “shaped” the new addition and again, badly. I now have a flat nail, with a small lump/hill near the cuticles but since she didn’t take the acrylic all the way up to the skin, there’s a sever slope/drop off with textured run off from the gel top coat. It looks moderately OK when your nails are naked but if you put nail polish on, every imperfection is revealed. Also, she managed to run the dremel over my skin while shaping my nails so I have pieces of dry skin lifting and causing hang nails. Two fingers were cut so bad I had to put on Neosporin and bandaits for a couple of days.

I'm very grateful to Brad (the owner) for making this happen. I def needed a place to work out after classes.

The space can seem a little small or scrunched together when u walk in. Especially with 10+ ppl.
Although, I like the fact u can see the trainer easily from every spot in the workout area.

Great house keeping makes the floors, lockers, mats, reception, and bags look virtually spot less.

Only complaint is I wish there were more classes on the weekends. Also, for beginners learning an 8 hit combo is frustrating. It can be pretty fast paced and my ""muscle memory"" isnt there yet. But the high energy is 100% encouraging. I'm still getting to know the trainers, but I'd be willing to have a beer with any of them. They all seem very chill (outside of their hyperactive trainer persona). Each one vary in experience but all good quality.

As far as ""boutique"" gyms go, I think this is pretty awesome. And there r always a fair amount of women (most times I find it's a majority of women) in each class. So it's never isolating for me if I want to talk to another female.

He has helped me not only with readjusting my body but has taught me how to stretch so that I can continue to alleviate some of my pain. I have gone from maybe 9/10 on my pain scale to a 7 most days and 5 on good days. I've only been going to him for the last 2 months. I have great hopes that by the end of 2021 I'll be at minimal pain. this is pain that I've been dealing with since I was 18 and I'm now 38 so you can understand even though it was a small change it is very major to me. so if you have pain and even if you don't and you want to just constantly keep your body in the right alignment you got to come to him he is so smart and he knows what he's talking about. I'm a nurse with my master's degree so I haven't heard him say something that's not in alignment with what I've already learned. Not to say that I know more than him because I don't.,,"{'time': 1621976588896, 'text': 'Thank you for this thoughtful review Adzua, we look foward to seeing you soon.'}",0x89c6fd639878f537:0x55844287b1de7262,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have worked for two separate builders spanning over the last several years, and both builders exclusively use James Carpets as their flooring & backsplash vendor.. and with great reason!  They offer the largest amount of color/material selections in their showroom with an extensive amount of knowledge for each type of product.  Scarlett, namely, has been such a big help in business and personal flooring decisions.  Not only is she extremely knowledgeable with all of the many products they offer, but she is also forthright with sharing extensive information on color variations (photos, additional samples, etc).  My husband and I also hired them to install tile, vinyl, hardwood, & backsplash into my personal home, and I'm beyond happy with their prices and completed work!

I would recommend James Carpets to anyone!!",,,0x88626b2e333be6d9:0x2a00a09a7045984f,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One person works behind the counter- she’s nice, be patient during our food worker shortage here in Las Vegas. They have soy milk as a dairy alternative, vanilla flavoring for drinks is $1 and the only flavor offered. Reasonable prices compared to that big chain, average $4-5.50/drink. My iced coffee with soy milk & vanilla added was $5.50 (nothing extra for the soy). Coffee tasted great, no burnt taste like that aforementioned chain. Almond croissant was delicious- not made on site at this little stand but fresh and good. You can also order ahead the day prior for the next morning from your room.

101482580653880160659,Cheyenne Duffy,1629838946848.0,1.0,This facility has gone down hill over the past year. I had to delete my review from my first visit just so I could type this one out & honestly I am heartbroken. As a mom who suffers with severe social anxiety it is a challenge for me to find locations I am comfortable with taking my daughter. The faculty at this location upon our visit today were confusing & did not communicate very well with me. My daughter has been waiting for 3 months to get fillings & they informed me today that she would have to wait another 3 even though her appointment was already scheduled for September. Upon my arrival other patients were taken back after having shown up after myself which is all fine & good but they didn't even bother to give me an estimated time for how much longer we would be waiting even though it was already past out appointment start time. Not to mention my toddler was throwing a fit in the lobby & they couldn't care less about the fact that we had been waiting so long. Now as I sit in my car in front of the building in tears typing this review I have to find another location to provide dental care for my daughter because Little Chompers has made me feel like a subpar parent. Not only have one of their dentists scolded me in the past for my toddlers oral health but they do not communicate with me & that is a big red flag. I truly hate leaving poor reviews like this but I hope maybe the company will see it & keep in mind that a little compassion goes a long way.,,,0x87c07b40e07bb465:0x9a82a96418cb0bbf,,,,,,,,,,,,,

101856865551768948430,Henry Haefner,1606162783440.0,1.0,"I had them replace two broken studs on my right rear wheel, these had been cross threaded by another shop that remained unknown until I purchased new tires. The did repair the two broken studs but in doing so cross threaded two more. I discovered this just yesterday while swapping summer to snow tires. (I have separate wheels for the winter and summer). While removing the lug nuts from the right rear wheel two lugs were extremely difficult to remove such that I had to use a 4' breaker bar to back the lugs off. The breaker bar was needed to completely remove the lug nuts. Two existing lugs were severely damaged due to cross threading. The shop states that is normal and occurs frequently. ""We did not damage your lugs"" was their response. The car is not old enough to suffer that kind of wear, they just will not admit to their mistake. Extremely disappointed in their service and negligence. See attached photos, beyond the seat of the lug nut the remaining section of the lugs are in good shape and did NOT wear out.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQa7V_Ibv9GfDZQXPeNGV3W_dY-rRCJhTYieY9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOX0LxkfikC3U2TFyXJaOB308ZAmCpJ7D0PFMdj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]","{'time': 1606226681412, 'text': 'Hi Henry our Customer Service Team would be happy to assist you.

Honest and fair prices too. Let's face it, an auto repair these days cost much more than years ago thanks to evolving technology. So if you're expectations are to repair your car for $20, then it's time to buy a bike. I've brought my 2013 ford Taurus SHO, 2007 GMC Yukon, 2004 Cadillac escalade, 2009 ford flex, 2006 Cadillac CTS, suburban, and many other cars. Never once was I treated poorly or over sold on products. And a BIG plus is you can bring your own parts in and they'll install it! (No warranty of course). I recently had my Yukon in before going to DC with our 5 children and luggage. They fixed a knock sensor and looked over the overall condition to make sure it was road worthy, and I only paid about $250. This was a great deal considering the GMC dealer probably would have cost twice as much and wouldn't get me in for a week. Great job midas Rutland. For all those skeptical, just try it!",,"{'time': 1520009810716, 'text': 'Hi Eric, thanks for sharing! We appreciate your loyalty to our shop and are glad to hear you enjoy each service with us.

Corporate experience was quick and gentlemen was very funny throughout process.  The guys who came to my home to install tank, check leaks and actually in detail explain the procedures as they were working was simply the BEST. This should be the only company or other companies should seek their model, professional services and support.  Thank You Keyser Energy and everyone that helped me get services up and running.

110520313897195655642,riskitonme,1550258953957.0,1.0,"I’ve been going to this salon for 6 years. Within the last year I had a problem with a stylist. The stylist took about 10 minutes on my hair, cut it way to short and charged me 30 dollars. I was very upset. EVERY haircut I’ve gotten has taken 25-40 minutes. That’s what I expect when I’m paying 30+ dollars for a haircut. I called to complain about this, the manager offered me some gift cards or something, I said that was not necessary, I felt happy after speaking with the manager. I’ve gotten Shelby for the last few haircuts and she had been doing an amazing job. Recently I came in again. The manager cut my hair this time. Answered the phone during my haircut (took about 3 minutes). Then said “I’m gonna try to hurry up and buzz you before my clippers die” I thought she was joking, apparently she was in a hurry since she only shampooed me and didn’t condition me. Everytime for 6+ years I’ve always gotten it conditioned, so it was clear she was in a hurry. Then while I was paying she answered the phone again, another 3 minutes. The entire haircut including the two phone calls took 15 minutes. I was basically balled and very upset. So I called to speak with the GM the GM sent my complaint to the manager. She called me and told me. ‘I’m sorry you were unhappy, I can offer you a complementary conditioning. Sorry it was so short, I come from  a barber settling , I don’t spend more than 10 minutes on a haircut.” This is upsetting because first of all it’s not complimentary when it’s suppose to come with my haircut,  2nd I didn’t have hardly any hair left after they cut it all off. And 3rd of all some haircuts take more than 10 minutes. She just made excuses like I knew she would.

In 27 years of going to different doctors offices, I've never had an office cancel an appointment for showing up 25 minutes early.

I'm giving 4 stars because the MD had good bedside manner, was thorough (still waiting on a referral however), and checked up on me through the patient portal website. The phlebotomist did a good job- he drew 5+ vials of blood and I barely felt it since he did a pretty good job making chit chat to distract me. My service at Pat Walker included more tests- EKG, eye exam, lab work, etc- and was CHEAPER than my med express bill.

100307574635854993764,Haley Savage,1540833248558.0,1.0,The worst banking/credit experience i’ve ever gone through. The most limited routes to paying your loan of any financial institution i’ve ever heard of. $10 over the phone $5 on their very own website BUT ITS FREE IF YOU SNAIL MAIL YOUR MONEY. Even if you’re locked out of your online account by their error they won’t wave the fees or take your money in any other way. Multiple times have falsely recorded financial agreements & when i went two separate times in the middle of the day to speak with someone to rectify the situation they left me in the waiting room for over an hour with ZERO communication that someone would be there to assist me in giving them their own money. The pudgey manager in the back office should cover his window if he’s going to eat multiple full size candy bars while ignoring eager customers wanting to again GIVE YOU MONEY. If you’re used to paying your bills on an app or handling billing issues in a few minutes over the phone this isn’t the place for you. No customer service on weekends or past 5 so forget trying to pay your bills on the weekend. You can set up autopay but you have to go in house to their 1 of 2 locations & fill out a paper. they’ll forget to file it as they have your financial arrangements in the past & they’ll make you drive all the way up to fill out the exact same paper. You can have the nicest staff in the world doesn’t cover up that y’all are stuck in the 90s.,,"{'time': 1542308074637, 'text': 'Hello Haley!\nWe are sorry to hear about your experience and would like to learn more about how we could improve future visits.

I like that the gym spaces are are big enough for you and a friend or two, but its still very private which let's you really focus.

Each workout is directed by a virtual guide which makes it very easy to follow along and very ever workout they show forms for: beginner, intermediate, and expert level participants.

Each one of those three left and we were still sitting in the waiting room an hour later. I told the receptionist I wanted my co-pay back because we have been waiting an hour and she told me there were no rooms available.  Why did she have to lie? I sat there and watched the same people that were called back finish and leave. There was no one else in the practice besides the staff. I refuse for a doctor to have no regard for my time.

She wasn't in when I called the other day either. I honestly don't think he has an assistant. Then, he kept calling his ""chaperone"" over to watch us anytime he ""touched me where a bikini would cover."" Excuse me, what? He spoke very disrespectfully to this chaperone lady, saying things like ""JUST BRING ME THE PHONE! WHY CAN'T YOU JUST FOLLOW DIRECTIONS!"" So awkward and awful. To top it off, he was wearing plastic shower shoes like on Orange is the New Black and his breath smelled terrible. Awful experience. He asked for my co-pay BEFORE the appointment, so when I couldn't take any more of his weirdness, I ran out to put more money in the meter and just hightailed it out of there. Do not recommend. The guy is a total weirdo and kind of scary. The other review on here is probably fake.

Update: After reading this review on yelp, they contacted me and downplayed everything I wrote, also managing to be rude to me in the process, saying that I checked my Apple watch texts too much.

The office part is the complete opposite- they overbook appointments, have you sit and wait over an hour past your time even if you let them know they are late, when you talk to anyone in the office they just ignore you... and let's not talk about billing! I've been overcharged so many times and was told by the billing person that she isn't used to private insurances or coverages so I did the research and showed her the policy only for me to end up paying over $200 for their error and then took me 5 months to get them to issue a refund for the overage. In all, the office and management are a mess but unfortunately they are the only dentist office in my area offering the services my family needs including orthodontist and x-rays.

They drill teeth that have no need to be fixed and try to push for other procedures you don't need. Because of them I had to have a tooth extracted because they made me wait for an appointment months away and refused to pull it and told me to take ibuprofen for pain and dismissed me. They also claimed that they needed to fix teeth that were already filled because there was decay below the fillings come to find out my new dentist did an x-ray and told me all of me teeth were in great shape.

With no consideration at all for anyone other than themselves, they hold up traffic, and yell and scream, and try to be as interrupting as possible while people are trying to work and businesses are trying to scratch out a living.  I can't imagine having no consideration for literally anyone in an entire town.   If you want to yell and scream please go to the playground.  I wouldn't recommend this business purely because of the hatred that will follow your patronage.

*Edit - none of the positive things that you do outweighs how much you disturb businesses and people trying to work downtown.  there is zero reason to create so much of a disturbance that people have to stop doing business until the drunkards in a vehicle move along.  It's beyond ridiculous to have people screaming at the top of their lungs and blasting music downtown when the same noise level is against city code for the same reasons.  Perhaps you should should start considering how you negatively affect others instead of bragging about it.",,"{'time': 1552407356977, 'text': 'Hi Jeff. Couple things to clarify here. Drunk people are not allowed to drive around in downtown Boise. And drunk people certainly are not allowed to drive our bikes. We provide a sober driver for every tour. Secondly, I can understand how watching a band of 15 people go by having an absolute blast could be annoying when your social calendar includes blasting businesses with zero regard for the positive things we create for downtown. We drive hundreds of thousand dollars through the doors of locally owned businesses each season. Over the last 5 years we have donated or raised more than $35,000 for local schools and non-profits. This year we also have a plan to build 50 bikes for kids through Boise Bicycle Project.  We would love to hear how you are improving the lives of those who live here through service or donations.\n\nWe provide a different and over the top experience for people looking to see downtown in a novel way while celebrating with friends and family. Perhaps doing a little research on the business before you make a claim like ""we have no consideration for anyone in an entire town"" or answering our request for constructive criticism before blasting your opinion would be helpful. This is not the first time you have trolled businesses in Boise, which makes me think you should fill up your free time by booking with us and experiencing what we offer first hand.

At first it wasn't bad we have had a few hiccups along the way but Clay was very understanding. Now it's been nothing but horrible.  This is the 4th time my husband hasn't gotten his pay check on time. My husband has been told numerous times he is not in dress code because he has been waiting for a jacket and has been waiting for a hat and has been told they're coming they're coming and he's never gotten them he has asked repeatedly for them but they just magically never appear.
I'm sure there will be black lash for him with me posting this but something needs to change with the payment of the employees. We are a family of 5 we have bills to pay and thankful that our landlord is understanding but this will only last for so long. The excuse of ""sorry they didn't send them out on time and they don't so direct deposit"" will only be accepted so many times.",,"{'time': 1606930153562, 'text': ""in 33 years, Majestic Security has mailed paychecks on Wednesday with payroll being made on Friday.  Everyone has the option of picking the checks up at the corporate office.  This payroll your speaking of occurred on Black Friday, and the checks were mailed priority mail on Tuesday.  The post office gave us a Wednesday delivery date, making payroll checks delivered actually 2 days early.  I checked and your husbands check was indeed delivered 1 day late on Saturday, and we apologized on behalf of the post office, but once we mail the checks, we are helpless as to when they are delivered.  You never called the office to inquire, and no one ever told you or anyone else that the checks were mailed late.  I assure you that in 33 years, checks are always mailed 2-3 days early to try and mitigate the late delivery of payroll.  I take peoples paychecks very seriously.  As far as uniforms are concerned, Majestic stocks 10,000 dollars of uniforms of all sizes 24/7 at all times.  I was told that his uniform jacket had been there for 2 weeks, and he never picked it up.  If it didn't fit, a simple phone call would have gotten a new one sent out that day.  We mail/deliver uniforms 3-4 days a week, every week, including weekends.  Since I have never spoken to you about these issues, you should have contacted me to either fix or explain this to you.  I am always available to speak with my employees about any concern that they have.""}",0x8816c4b2fb8fb6a1:0x80451636e10ca83f,,,,,,,,,,,,,

106389802276420994691,Happy Buddha,1554141609303.0,1.0,"I called this store yesterday (Sunday)at 3:46 in the afternoon. This is the store that I purchased the cell phone from the day before Christmas...so this was the store I called when I had a question about the phone malfunctioning. The young man that answered the phone didn't even attempt to be helpful. I told him the phone was Auto resetting to factory on its own and that it's done it three times dumping everything in the phone. I asked what I needed to do to get a warranty exchange because the phone is only 3 months old. He asked if I had cricket insurance on it I said no the phone is 3 months old and under warranty. He then said oh we don't do that you need to call Samsung. I said since when does a customer have to call Samsung, the phone manufacturer, for a warranty exchange? He said we just don't do that you have to contact Samsung. I again questioned why the store wasn't giving directions for warranty exchanges his reply was ""WE'RE A FRANCHISE"". So my take away from that is that they'll sell you a phone but that's where the customer service stops. After getting off the phone with this store, I called The Colony location and the man at that location was so helpful (even though I didn't buy the phone there)... he said that all I needed to do was dial 611 from a different phone on my family plan so that I had the phone that was malfunctioning available to read the numbers under the battery to them and that they would arrange for my warranty exchange. It took the gentleman at the Colony location less time to give me those simple instructions (less than 1 minute from start to finish) than it took the young man at the Little Elm location to keep refusing to give me the same information, give me incorrect information and make excuses. I was on the phone with Cricket (not samsung) for maybe 5 minutes.  I have a claim number and everything set up to ship it back to them and a new phone arrives within two days. Now, how come the Colony location can help a customer with basic directions on what to do, yet the Little Elm location says they're a franchise/not their problem? In the future I think I'll simply buy my next 4 new phones at the Colony location (since all the phones are the same) so that I feel like the customer service stays with me the whole entire time I'm a customer...not just while I have my wallet open. Little Elm Cricket...that's how you earn customer/brand loyalty...or in your case lose it. Owner...save the form reply you will attach to this review and use that few minutes training your employees on proper phone etiquette and directions on how a customer can initiate a warranty return through cricket... it would be time well spent. You never get a second chance to keep a customer",,"{'time': 1554224846584, 'text': 'Kimberly we apologize for the experience you had at our local store.

There is a bath house with 1 set of coin operated washer/dryer, 2 restrooms (sink toilet) and 2 shower rooms (sink, toilet, shower). The hot water will run out after a few showers. They provide floor mats towels for you to use which is nice, but they lack vent fans to remove moisture so it is prone to mold.

I always try to be as fair as possible to the customer but was constantly surprised with how many times they had screwed my customers. Many times they did not disclose adding on warranties that were never asked for by the customer. Lied many times about interest rates on loans. Frequently they lied on the loan apps regarding income of the customer. Low inventory levels were a constant problem. Many vehicles have minor damage and replacement parts needed, however the dealership would refrain from fixing these items in the name of bigger profits. I would never ever send any of my friends or family there as I was afraid they would be lied to as many of my customers were. Steer clear of this place.

I called on Tuesday 2/2/2021 and Oscar came out.  He was so knowledgeable and took the time to listen to the problem.  He  resolved the issue and stayed to let the heater heat through 3 cycles to be sure the noise was gone.

I notice that most of your 42 reviews are saying negative things about businesses so I can't really take you seriously. You can call me, the owner Jill, and we can chat. 720-616-7878""}",0x876b81967e1a67c9:0x5809cc9e95e607c8,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I cannot thank them enough to for helping me. I was very scared to do the procedure without laughing gas but the dental assistant made feel more relaxed and the dr. made sure I was completely numb before starting (I tend to require extra numbing meds). First time in weeks I haven't been in excruciating pain.

The creme brulee was bad. The texture was all wrong and the only thing saving it is that in the end it's still all sugar -- so it's at least sweet.

The strawberry and peach cobbler is a large dish for a dessert but pretty great, I'd definitely order this one again (but I'll also probably not be coming back here)

The place is pretty pricey for the quality. Wait staff is young and inexperienced, awkward, and spacey. Very sub par service -- we were seemingly forgotten about a few times.

I agree with the other reviewer that it seems every employee there is literally only there because their mom made them get a job. They are SO SLOW. I put an order in ahead of time, show up 15 minutes later & the place is DEAD and they haven’t even started my juice yet they’re just standing around. They ask “oh do you have an online order? I’ll make it now”. Either their system for online orders needs to be re evaluated so they are better notified when one is placed or they need to be managed properly and actually be alert and work faster. They are all in a daze just standing around. I wouldn’t normally say anything but like I mentioned this has happened nearly every single time I go here and now when I tell my husband let’s go grab a juice he’s like “oh no that place takes forever”.

101947463367400405193,Kelsey Berteaux,1552676558844.0,2.0,"Went here to get an acai bowl for lunch while my colleagues ate at Teriyaki Grill and Village Baker (both in the same parking lot). Despite walking in and ordering immediately with only two orders in front of me, my food was the last to be ready out of the three lunch venues. I don't know why acai bowls take so long to make, but that seems to be the case everywhere. IDKY.

In addition to the slowness, the acai bowl I received, while pretty, was lacking in flavor. The base was watery and tasted like there was too much ice mixed in. It's probably the worst acai bowl I have ever eaten (which is disappointed because I LOVE acai).

Last, the granola on top was made with rice krispy cereal in it? It was a strange texture that I didn't enjoy.

Long story short, will not be returning and do not recommend. However, if you are coming here for the first time and want to try yourself, here are some tips:

- Order ahead online! This would have fixed my slowness issue.
- Bring you vegan friends--they have vegan ice creams here",,"{'time': 1619485031063, 'text': 'Please come on back for our new look, new hours, and new flavors.\nWe have new staff,  they are very well trained and Nekter is under new ownership!\nWe now offer $5 Fridays for super food smoothies and amazing staff!

Delicious granola and really added to the smoothie, we loved it and decided it was worth the extra charge.

I wouldn't have been surprised to learn they had shackles holding them at the counter. For  5 items,we received 2 napkins. When my wife asked for a suggestion, one girl said in monotone: ""today's sub is the steak..."". When we asked to verify that the had a meal ordered for one of the sandwiches, the cashier simply repeated the price. When we went to divvy up the food, we realized that they had given no indication of what was what. It was all in one bag and we had to have people open each other food then open the sandwich/wrap then pass it around.

On top of the service issues, this location does not serve flat bread pizza.

The food never dips in quality, and they have the best Chicken Parm Sub you’ll ever find around here. The atmosphere is always nice, which was a step up from Franco’s which would occasionally feel cramped if it was extra busy (idk how they managed it being in the same building as Franco’s was).

My mother was not replacing the mattress because of bed bugs.

The delivery drivers just left the mattress and box spring next to the dumpster instead placing them inside. I removed them over a week and I do not have bed bugs.
The 3 things you were not honest about was 1. you were supposed to apply a 10% discount instead of $10.00 discount. 2. You were suppose to deliver it between 4pm and 5pm not at 6:pm and I had to call you to find out why the delivery was late. 3.

Not impressed and in my humbled opinion it appeared they were either going out of business or closing down soon because contrary to their reputation, the place was not busy or crowded and was not fun at all.

116779302401903095838,Kameron Nicole,1612924251104.0,3.0,"Had to wait 15 minutes for two meals. But after letting the guy know who brought our food out of how long we waited he offered to get us a coupon which was nice but they should just have those ready to save time. It lets you know how long an order is on the screen and the limit is like 4 mins or close to it. Also mother nature was screaming my name and the drive thru attendant informed us that their restrooms were closed which I thought was kind of illegal when you serve food but I guess not in today's America. The filet-o-fish was disappointing, haven't had one in a long time and when I took a bite some liquid squirted out, gross I know. A filet-o-fish should be a perfect and even crispness with no soggy parts like this one. Also after waiting that long for it I figured it would be perfectly handcrafted but it looks like a blind person made it. No offense to the blind because even they can line up angles and know that the fish filet is hanging half way off the bun and the top bun was hanging on for dear life.
P.s. the frozen Coca-Cola had good flavor but when I got it, it wasn't filled up all the way and I thought maybe they were accounting for melting but even when it melted it still was very far from the top. I feel a little jipped. I'll be cashing in my coupon at a different mcdonalds and hopefully they won't let me down. Spicy nuggets were spicy that is an accurate statement.","[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZegTYyWvsH178tFM95ErKT0eoVIDAeKnl3NtO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBHVBY_Z4b6_LbhyjBeF5UdCZZlyAaVQtmExxl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmCplnyFyieW4qN-lbp8lsEetLbe5UglQUj46c=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwdEPny-C9EX82tlxzaShyGvaqhYEgoOe-xuDa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBWbqnZvM22LA2oRlL8HK48F5BYJfRExGyr0Ww=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]",,0x53540a4f7d86c193:0x4e821cad8ac2d27,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EDIT: Just went back for a second time and wanted to add some additional verbiage regarding why Thrive is our new favorite vet.

First and foremost, I love that they take COVID seriously and that they have very organized plan for keeping people safe. Sometimes, COVID restrictions are very confusing to consumers, but Thrive does a fantastic job with planning and execution of safety protocols. I love that they care about their vets and vet techs, as well as their other staff and their customers, enough to create a thoughtful plan to keep everyone safe.

Second, I love how quick it is to get your animal(s) in and out of their facility. We've gone twice now - once with one dog, and a second time with two dogs. Both times were very efficient.

Third, I love the price. Very reasonable for high quality service.

Finally, I love the communication. The vet called me after seeing my dogs both times and communicated everything in a way that was easy to understand without feeling watered down. The vet was cordial and professional. It's wild to me that none of the other vets we've seen (10+) have noticed my dogs umbilical hernia. This vet pointed it out and assured me that it was nothing to panic over. Truly an ear to tail review!

I absolutely love Thrive and we decided as of our most recent experience that they will be our vet going forward. Thanks Thrive!",,"{'time': 1601434506858, 'text': 'I am so happy to hear that you had a wonderful experience with us!

Dr. Barksdale took the time to text me in the days after Fin visited to ensure he was doing well or answer any questions I may have. That was AWESOME of her and made me feel valued as a customer. I've never had a Vet do that before, and was one component in making my decision to switch Vet care super easy.

I have been struggling to find a good, clean, friendly, and affordable vet on the westside of Atlanta. I think I just found it!

One of the most important things for me is that they allow me to book appointments online. I know that sounds silly, but so many places pretend to offer that, but they really just end up calling you while you're at work and don't actually allow you to book something online. With Thrive I was able to see all of their open time slots and pick the one that works best for me.

They are so gentle with all three of my kitties and they made sure to only find out exactly what tests my kitties need just to see how their organs are functioning and find out how they’re doing internally. They do have insanely good prices. I had so much stuff done on all 3 cats the same day that the number of things done, ran over onto a second page of the invoice! The price would have been through the roof if I had gone somewhere else. Soon, I’ll come back and get teeth cleaning done.

Doc said no, diagnosed a tumor. Doc advised that he would need to do surgical procedure to remove it, get it tested to determine what type of tumor it was, and determine further treatment. I declined for us to partake in the procedure. He advised that it would have to be done eventually.  While leaving,  the bump burst and started bleeding. Days later, no more bump. Hair has grown back where bump used to be.  It was a sty, as suspected. Also before leaving, nurse/tech had scheduled a follow up appt, including providing date and time. When I called to cancel the appt, because the issue had resolved itself, I was informed that there was no scheduled appt in the books for my dog. 😔 Hence my review rating. Nice people, not so dependable service nor diagnosis. #furbabies",[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOf_fpWAnXoreAFFiBU9Ccz0C321RDKikIW6voV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}],,0x88f505951b4acdb3:0x4b26d4714842a715,,,,,,,,,,,,,
